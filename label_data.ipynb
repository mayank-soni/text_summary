In the memorial booklet, his family described Benaud as 'a special person who means so much to each of us in many different ways.' Benaud, considered one of the most influential cricket identities of the past century, played 63 tests for Australia but was more well-known for his career in the commentating booth.

And they're not done yet, not by a long way. Bayern still have five Bundesliga matches to play as they march towards a third consecutive title, the German Cup semi-final against Borussia Dortmund on April 28, and potentially three Champions League matches, should they reach the final. If Guardiola's goalscoring machine churns them out at their current rate of 2.61 per game, that would mean an eyewatering total of 141 goals for the season.

Warnock was driving through a canyon in Lewiston, Idaho, on Wednesday when he saw the tree, then looked up to see an SUV dangling over the edge of a cliff. The only thing holding the GMC Yukon and its terrified driver from a 30-foot drop was a crumpled chain-link fence, still clinging to the earth above Bryden Canyon Road. \"I seen that guy hanging there and he was trying to beat the window out or the door open and I was like \\'Oh man,\\' \\'cause only like five links were hanging there,\" Warnock told KXLY, a CNN affiliate. \"I was like, I gotta do something and no one was doing anything.\" What Warnock did next, captured in a dramatic photo by Lewiston Tribune photographer Barry Kough, made headlines around the world. Warnock dashed from his car and scrambled up a hill to the Yukon and its driver, 23-year-old Matthew Sitko, who appeared to be in shock. \"I got up there and I was like, \\'Are you alright man?\\' He shook his head, yeah. I grabbed my Snap-on multi-tool and it had jagged edges on each end. I hit the window three times and it didn\\'t break.

Warnock then reached in and pulled Sitko out to safety -- a moment recorded by Kough\\'s camera. Then Warnock disappeared. \"I left and got out of there before anyone knew who I was,\" he said. He remained an unknown good Samaritan, his identity a mystery, until Kough\\'s picture of the daring rescue appeared in the Lewiston paper and spread across the Internet. \"I don\\'t feel like I deserve any credit or anything,\" Warnock said. \"I just did what anyone would do, went right back to work.\" Thanks to Warnock, Sitko went to the hospital with just minor injuries. \"The Lewiston Police Department would like to thank Jason Warnock for his quick and decisive actions in helping Mr. Sitko and preventing the situation from worsening,\" said Roger Lanier, the interim police chief.

            "{'sequence': '(CNN)The mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, which began 100 years ago Friday, is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century, even though the word \"genocide\" did not exist at the time. The issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional, both for Armenians, who are descended from those killed, and for Turks, the heirs to the Ottomans. For both groups, the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts. Some Armenians feel their nationhood cannot be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged. Some Turks still view the Armenians as having been a threat to the Ottoman Empire in a time of war, and say many people of various ethnicities -- including Turks -- were killed in the chaos of war. In addition, some Turkish leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations. So, what do we know about happened in those fateful days? Here are some answers: . The Ottoman Turks, having recently entered World War I on the side of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were worried that Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire would offer wartime assistance to Russia. Russia had long coveted control of Constantinople (now Istanbul), which controlled access to the Black Sea -- and therefore access to Russia\\'s only year-round seaports. Many historians agree that the number was about 2 million. However, victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million Armenians living in the Caucasus under Russian rule, some of whom were massacred by Ottoman forces in 1918 as they marched through East Armenia and Azerbaijan. By 1914, Ottoman authorities were already portraying Armenians as a threat to the empire\\'s security. Then, on the night of April 23-24, 1915, the authorities in Constantinople, the empire\\'s capital, rounded up about 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. Many of them ended up deported or assassinated. April 24, known as Red Sunday, is commemorated as Genocide Remembrance Day by Armenians around the world. Friday is the 100th anniversary of that day. This is a major point of contention. Estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923, with not all of the victims in the Ottoman Empire. But most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918, made by Ottoman authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million. Whether due to killings or forced deportation, the number of Armenians living in Turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922. Almost any way one can imagine. While the  death toll is in dispute, photographs from the era document some mass killings. Some show Ottoman soldiers posing with severed heads, others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt. The victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning, torture, gas, poison, disease and starvation. Children were reported to have been loaded into boats, taken out to sea and thrown overboard. Rape, too, was frequently reported. In addition, according to the website armenian-genocide.org, \"The great bulk of the Armenian population was forcibly removed from Armenia and Anatolia to Syria, where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger.\" No. Genocide was not even a word at the time, much less a legally defined crime. The word \"genocide\" was invented in 1944 by a Polish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin to describe the Nazis\\' systematic attempt to eradicate Jews from Europe. He formed the word by combining the Greek word for race with the Latin word for killing. Genocide became a crime in 1948, when the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The definition included acts meant \"to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\" Armenia, the Vatican, the European Parliament, France, Russia and Canada. Germany is expected to join that group on Friday, the 100th anniversary of the start of the killings. Turkey, the United States, the European Commission, the United Kingdom and the United Nations. A U.N. subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985, but current U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declines to use the word. Also, a year ago, on the eve of the 99th anniversary of Red Sunday, then-Turkish Prime Minister (now-President) Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences for the mass killings, which he said had \"inhumane consequences.\" While Turkey vehemently continues to reject the word \"genocide,\" his remarks went further than those of any previous Turkish leader in acknowledging the suffering of Armenians.', 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.7892321944236755, 0.21076783537864685]}\n",
            "{'sequence': '(CNN)It\\'s a warm afternoon in Miami, and 35-year-old Emanuel Vega has come to Baptist Health Primary Care for a physical exam. Dr. Mark Caruso shakes his hand with a welcoming smile. Vega, a strapping man with a thick black beard, is feeling good, but he came to see the doctor today because his wife thought he should -- she even made the appointment. It is free to him under his insurance policy with no co-pay, as most preventive care is under the Affordable Care Act. Vega is one of more than 44 million Americans who is taking part in a medical ritual: visiting the doctor for an annual physical exam. But there\\'s little evidence that those visits actually do any good for healthy adults. Caruso listens to Vega\\'s heart and lungs, checks his pulse in his ankles and feels around his lymph nodes. He also asks Vega about his exercise and sleeping schedule and orders blood and urine tests. As long as everything checks out, Caruso asks Vega to return for another exam in a year. Vega says he definitely will. It was a positive experience for both doctor and patient, and they\\'re not alone; 92 percent of Americans say it is important to get an annual head-to-toe physical exam, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation). And 62 percent of those polled said they went to the doctor every year for their exam. But the evidence is not on their side. \"I would argue that we should move forward with the elimination of the annual physical,\" says Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, a primary care physician and a professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School. Mehrotra says patients should really only go to the doctor if something is wrong, or if it\\'s time to have an important preventive test like a colonoscopy. He realizes popular opinion is against this view. \"When I, as a doctor, say I do not advocate for the annual physical, I feel like I\\'m attacking moms and apple pie,\" Mehrotra says. \"It seems so intuitive and straightforward, and [it\\'s] something that\\'s been part of medicine for such a long time.\" But he says randomized trials going back to the 1980s just don\\'t support it. The Society for General Internal Medicine even put annual physicals on a list of things doctors should avoid for healthy adults. One problem, Mehrotra says, is the cost. Each visit usually costs insurers just $150, but that adds up fast. \"We estimate that it\\'s about $10 billion a year, which is more than how much we spend as a society on breast cancer care,\" Mehrotra says. \"It\\'s all a lot of money.\" And then there\\'s the risk that a doctor will run a test and find a problem that\\'s not actually there. It\\'s called a false positive, and it can lead to a cascade of follow-up tests that can be expensive and could even cause real harm. Dr. Michael Rothberg is another primary care physician and a health researcher at the Cleveland Clinic. He generally avoids giving physicals. \"I generally don\\'t like to frighten people and I don\\'t like to give them diseases they don\\'t have,\" Rothberg says. \"I mostly tell my family, \\'if you\\'re feeling well, stay away from doctors. If you get near them, they\\'ll start to look for things and order tests because that\\'s what doctors do.\\' \" \"The flip side of that is if you\\'re not feeling well, don\\'t keep it to yourself. Don\\'t minimize it. Don\\'t pretend it\\'s not there,\" he adds. Rothberg says he still has patients who always schedule an annual exam. For those patients, he skips the physical aspects of the exam and focuses instead on talking to them about their dietary and exercise habits, possible risks, age-appropriate vaccinations and any screening tests they may need. The guidelines discouraging annual physicals are aimed specifically at asymptomatic adults. Dr. David Fleming, president of the American College of Physicians, says it\\'s important for elderly patients to be seen on a regular basis, to \"do a full assessment of everything -- how they live at home, if the conditions are safe, are they at risk of falling? They need a flu shots every year. This is a population where it\\'s definitely indicated.\" Back in Miami, Caruso is also well versed in the research on annual physicals, but he still believes in them. \"I think having a look at somebody is worth its weight in gold,\" he says. It\\'s an important part of developing a relationship with a patient, he says, and there have been countless times when he\\'s found real problems during an exam just like the one he gave to Vega. \"What if Mr. Vega had had a lump or bump that wasn\\'t right?\" Caruso asks. \"What if when he had his shirt off, Mr. Vega said, \\'Oh yeah, I forgot to mention this spot on my chest,\\' and it ended up being a melanoma we discovered early?\" And Vega did end up needing a little help -- he has a bad back that\\'s landed him in the ER several times. Caruso was able to link him up with a back specialist to help him manage the problem.

He positioned himself at the base of the tree and turned his camera upward, filling the frame with the trunk and its spindly branches. \"I\\'m kind of a walking photographer,\" Le Coq said. \"I love exploring new places. One day I was taking a break during an excursion in the Broceliande forest, looking for the best place to settle, when I discovered a small clearing with a tree without leaves. I stayed for hours looking around, taking some pictures and I found myself lying down under the tree. The tree\\'s branches were rising as if to touch the sky.\" This was the start of the photo series \"Treesome,\" an embodiment of Le Coq\\'s unique way of interacting with the world around him. \"By walking a long time in an environment, landscapes begin to influence on your mood,\" he said. \"As (landscapes) change, your feelings do.\" The series, shot between 2012 and 2014, reflects Le Coq\\'s travels through his native France and countries in Central America and Asia. The images are soothing and repetitive; each tree is photographed from the bottom looking up. But it is from this vantage point that the differences become apparent. Branches take on their own patterns in the sky, creating a symmetry that is both interesting and comforting. A row of trees shot in Paris speaks to the geometry of a modern city. Cactus branches look like spears piercing the sky. Appearance is not the only factor that sets the trees apart. For Le Coq, each image is special because it represents different feelings at different points in time. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"Each tree has its own personality,\" he said. \"I chose them by the way I felt at the moment. Sometimes they even change my sentiments. It\\'s kind of a spiritual experience.\" Le Coq says his photographs are meant to bring about pause and reflection. The viewer should \"become a third actor in a scene with trees and skies.\" It is an opportunity to take a break and focus on our own individual journeys. \"Treesome\" is shot in black and white, an aesthetic Le Coq says lends tension \"recalling the gulf on one side and the celestial heights on the other. \"The branches are the mirror of the roots.\" As a freelance graphic designer, Le Coq can work wherever there is an Internet connection.  He uses this freedom to travel, discover new places and grow as a photographer.

Perhaps the great jazz and rock music scene in Denmark is for you? It\\'s not just the fun activities that make locals and travelers to those countries happy, according to the third World Happiness Report, released by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations on April 23. People who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies and more social support, experience more generosity, have more freedom to make life choices, have lower perceptions of corruption and have a higher gross domestic product per capita, the report shows. The tiny country of Bhutan, a very happy country famous for measuring the \"Gross National Happiness\" of its people, gets the credit for focusing world attention on happiness: Its Prime Minister proposed the idea of a World Happiness Day to the United Nations in 2011. Recognizing \"happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world,\" the U.N. General Assembly declared March 20 as World Happiness Day in 2012. This officially designated happy date marked its fourth year last month. Through the happiness report, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network hopes to encourage governments at every level to measure and improve their people\\'s happiness. \"There is no single key to happiness,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, the network\\'s director and an economics professor at Columbia University. \"All of these countries do well in several ways. Being rich? That\\'s good, but it\\'s only a modest part of the story. Trusting society, having a government that ranks on low in corruption, a society where people are generous and volunteering -- all of these are important for happiness.\" Even if you don\\'t live in one of the 10 happiest countries in the world, a visit to these happy places will give you a taste of what the locals enjoy every day. Here are the top 10 happiest places on Earth, according to the World Happiness Report. 1. Switzerland . Switzerland took the top spot from Denmark in 2015, rising from third to first place in this year\\'s list of the world\\'s happiest countries. Bern, the capital city of Switzerland, has the cobblestone streets and medieval architecture that make it apparent why the old city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the city\\'s founding in the 12th century, it has expanded in an often neat and orderly fashion. And the lovely River Aare offers in-town swimming and boating. Looking to get out of the capital city? Book a trip to Lucerne, where you can take a boat trip on the lake, ride the panorama gondola, take in the views on the new Dragon Ride aerial cableway and ride on the world\\'s steepest cog railway. Book the Golden Round trip and get all four trips -- and stunning views of the Alps -- in one day. (The railway reopens in mid-May.) And no matter where you go, there will certainly be plenty of delicious chocolate to try. 2. Iceland . Nature and culture combine to make Iceland a truly happy place, so delightful that the tiny country jumped from ninth to second place this year. Explore South Iceland, where many of the ancient tales -- called sagas -- that document Iceland\\'s 10th- and 11th-century history are remembered.  A two-hour drive from the capital city of Reykjavik, south Iceland is home to Vatnajokull Glacier, the 60-meter (197-foot) Skogafoss Waterfall and amazing fresh seafood. (Though you could probably skip the fermented shark ...) No matter where you visit, there\\'s probably a geothermal swimming pool or hot spring spa to soak your weary bones after a long day of exploring. And when you get back to the capital, note that the renowned annual Reykjavik Art Festival will take place from May 17 through June 7. 3. Denmark . Never mind that Denmark lost the top spot this year and is now the third-happiest country in the world. Looking at all that Danes have to be happy about, you won\\'t notice the slight dip while you\\'re enjoying jazz at the Copenhagen Jazz Festival in July, hanging out with the hipsters at Queen Louise\\'s Bridge, taking a canal tour or playing beach volleyball in front of the Royal Danish Playhouse. Prefer your music in the woods? Head to Smuk Fest (\"The Beautiful Festival\"), a rock/pop festival in the woods of Skanderborg held in August. Wherever you go, enjoy that Danish tradition of \"hygge,\" sometimes translated too simply as the need for \"coziness.\" It\\'s really a complex sense of intimacy, community and contentment that generally happens with friends and family, and it makes for one happy country. Project Happy: 10 ways to get happy . 4. Norway . The sun never sets in some parts of Norway during the summer months, and the North Cape area is one of the best spots to play when the sun stays out for 24 hours. Visitors love to golf, hike and even run a marathon during the months ruled by the midnight sun. If your taste buds dictate your travels, head to the Norwegian capital city of Oslo, a gastronomic paradise where the Michelin food guide has awarded five stars among four restaurants: Ylajali, Statholdergaarden and Fauna (one star each) and Maeemo (two stars). 5. Canada . Canada combines European style, sensibility and history with the enormous natural wonder of North America. Within the French-speaking province of Quebec, a tour through the historic city of Old Quebec is a treat for any Francophile. Founded in the early 17th century, it\\'s the only North American city north of Mexico that still has its fortifications. The historic district is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Just a few minutes from downtown Quebec City, Ile d\\'Orleans is a small island where farming and agriculture are still a way of life. And if nature is what you crave, in less an hour from Québec City, you could be hiking through the Parc national de la Jacques-Cartier, home to the glacial Vallée de la Jacques-Cartier. 50 states, 50 spots to get happy around the U.S. 6. Finland . What a happy event to spot the rare Saimaa ringed seal, which adapted to freshwater living after the Ice Age cut off its lake home from the sea. There are only about 300 of them in the world, and they can be found at Lake Saimaa in eastern Finland. But you might have more luck spotting the white whooper swan, Finland\\'s national bird, whose arrival heralds the start of spring. For a more urban experience, visit Helsinki\\'s Market Square and Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma. And you can still spot animals in the capital city: In mid-May, the cows will be herded into the fields in Viikki, a neighborhood in Helsinki, after the long winter. Locals always gather to celebrate this moo-ving event. 7. Netherlands (Holland) Though the Netherlands\\' tulips are without equal, and they are most stunning at Keukenhof (known as the Garden of Europe), there are so many beautiful spots across the country to walk and bike to welcome spring and its trademark flower. For a more regal celebration, note that the kingdom celebrates its 200th year this year with many festivities. 8. Sweden . In a country that\\'s very fond of celebration, Swedes love to celebrate midsummer, the longest day of the year, most of all. It\\'s a national holiday marked with traditional food and dances around a maypole. Can\\'t make the midsummer parties? There\\'s still plenty to do. Just 20 minutes from the capital city of Stockholm, the Stockholm Archipelago of about 30,000 islands offers endless opportunities for contentment. Swimming, hiking, cycling, fishing, horseback riding -- it\\'s all within your reach by booking a boat ride. (Some boat trips include meals and tours of many of the islands.) 9. New Zealand . New to the top 10 list of happiest countries, New Zealand has plenty of reasons to celebrate. Though it\\'s always been an attractive spot to explore, Peter Jackson choosing the country to host the filming of the \"Lord of the Rings\" movie trilogy has given New Zealand more attention than money could buy. The capital city of Wellington has benefited from the growth of the movie industry, developing a happening restaurant and design scene. And many of the country\\'s natural wonders have gained international attention, including the 2,291-meter (7,516-foot)-high Mount Ngauruhoe, which played the fictional Mount Doom. It\\'s part of Tongariro National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 10. Australia . The Great Barrier Reef, the world\\'s largest collection of coral reefs, is a natural phenomenon not to be missed. Australians are arguing fiercely over manmade threats to its existence  (and no one is happy about that). Once you\\'ve had a chance to explore that magical underwater realm, head to the Australian state of Tasmania, an island 240 kilometers (149 miles) off the mainland coast. The Tasmanian Wilderness, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, includes one of the last surviving temperate rainforests in the world. To see the wilderness up close, try hiking the stunning 65-kilometer (40-mile) Overland Track.

Firefighters remained at the scene in St Catherine’s Hill nature reserve until 1.15am yesterday, after the blaze was finally brought under control. Police are treating the fire as suspicious and have appealed for witnesses as they investigate what was used to start it. Two schoolboys have today been arrested for the arson attack that devastated the sensitive heathland. The youths, aged 14 and 15, are being held by police on suspicion of deliberately starting three fires. Firefighters said that while it has rained in the area, the hilly landscape meant little moisture remained near the top of the soil. There was also a lot of dead, dry growth left over from winter, which had been the sunniest since records began in 1929. Commander Craig Baker of Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘It is probably one of the largest heath fires we’ve had for a couple of years. The main problem yesterday was the strength of the wind.’ The area, a site of special scientific interest, is home to all six species of reptile native to the UK, including sand lizards, adders and grass snakes. Experts said thousands of creatures would have been killed by the blaze. Around 50 wildlife volunteers were yesterday rescuing reptiles that survived. Nicky Hoar from Dorset Wildlife Trust said it would take 20 to 30 years for the heathland ecosystem to fully recover. Dorset Police have confirmed they are treating the fire as suspicious and investigations are ongoing but no arrests have been made yet . Billowing black smoke could be seen from 10 miles away in Wimborne and Swanage as crews battled to get the 400 metre wide fire under control . The heathland is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and home to all six species of reptile native to the UK; the sand lizard, smooth snake, adders, slow worms, grass snakes and common lizards . The huge wildlife, which was sparked by arsonists, has destroyed an area of heathland the size of a hundred football pitches in Dorset . But 350 miles away, it looked more like Christmas as a coating of snow caused a headache for unprepared commuters yesterday morning. Residents of Northumberland, Cumbria and County Durham were expecting April showers but the region’s highlands were instead blanketed in a freezing flurry. Lowson Robinson, who has been working on a model village in his garden in Cumbria for more than ten years, said: ‘The village looks lovely in the snow. There was a little flurry yesterday but I didn’t expect it to lie.’ The retired coal miner, 67, added: ‘It’s snowing today and I think it might continue until the weekend but then that should be it for the year. The weather here can get pretty bad and we get a lot of snow so it’s hard to tell but spring should be just around the corner.’ Yesterday, forecasters said there is a risk of rain across the country for the rest of the week and it will continue to be a bit colder than the seasonal average. In the south, temperatures could fall to -1C (30F). John Griffiths of MeteoGroup said: ‘Easter Sunday and Monday should be drier and brighter with sunny spells.’ Fire crews spent most of yesterday battling to bring the blaze under control and officers spent last night dampening the area down and returned today to ensure to fire didn't reignite . Experts say thousands of the creatures will have been killed by the blaze. Some 50 wildlife volunteers spent today rescuing reptiles that survived by burrowing into deep ground.

A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a key role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s . Benaud's wife, Daphne politely declined Prime Minister Tony Abbott's offer of a state funeral for her husband . A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators. In a broadcast career spanning more than five decades, he was instrumental in establishing one-day cricket on television. Masses of Australian cricketers, politicians and sportspeople penned heartfelt tributes on social media in the wake of his passing. Former Australian spin bowler Shane Warne called the champion leg spinner, the 'Godfather of cricket'. 'As a cricketer, commentator and as a person, you were the best there's ever been,' he wrote. Former captain Richie Benaud stands by a sculpture of himself at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2008 . Floral tributes gathered at the bronze statue of Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground .

'After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous or more influential than Richie Benaud.' 'He loved winning. He helped the Australian team have the attitude where they wanted to win. He played the game the right way. 'There's no doubt he's certainly going to be missed.' Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I grew up listening to Richie Benaud's wonderful cricket commentary. Like all fans of the sport, I will miss him very much.' Benaud was one of the world's most recognised commentators having initially started with the BBC in England before anchoring the Nine Network's cricket coverage in Australia for decades . Richie Benaud married his wife Daphne in July 1967 . A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators . Former Prime Minister John Howard greeted Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground back in 2001 . Benaud was born in Penrith in western Sydney in October 1930. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Benaud was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets yet was as much renowned for his captaincy - he never lost a Test series as Australian captain. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets . Penrith-born Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964 . 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap... because Keith Miller never wore a cap, ' Benaud said at the time. 'It's one of those things in life: you live and learn as you go along.' As captain he led Australia to four consecutive series victories, beginning with a 4-0 demolition of Peter May's 1958-59 tourists (Benaud took 31 wickets in the five tests).

            "{'sequence': \"Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez is a star-studded strike force that almost every team in the world would dearly love to have, but when the going gets tough, Barcelona turn to Jeremy Mathieu and Gerard Pique. The French centre-back flung himself through the air to reach Xavi's free kick at the back post, heading home from close range, finally breaching Celta Vigo's stern defence. It was Mathieu who had opened the scoring in the El Clasico, in similar fashion. Pique, meanwhile, just a minute before Mathieu scored, had made an incredible, game-saving tackle on Celta striker Charles, to prevent him from opening the scoring.

Goals: Mathieu 73' Booked: Suarez . Ref: Inaki Vicandi Garrido . Att: 23,731 . This gritty, barely-deserved triumph helped Barcelona stay four points ahead of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, after Ancelotti’s side's almost-harrowing 9-1 demolition of Granada . Celta Vigo’s aggressive pressing nearly paid dividends, but their hard-work and effort counted for nothing thanks to Mathieu’s goal. Their frustration manifested itself in a bizarre way, with Fabian Orellana sent off for throwing a lump of turf at Sergio Busquets. For some reason Sergio Alvarez, Celta Vigo's goalkeeper, is kryptonite for Barcelona's attacking trident, as they also failed to beat him in 90 minutes at the Camp Nou earlier this season. After Barcelona's Halloween nightmare against Celta Vigo, the directive from Luis Enrique here was not to leave with egg on their faces on Easter Sunday. Barcelona's own website stated that 'a dose of retribution' was in order, after the 1-0 defeat by Eduardo Berizzo’s side in late autumn. Before the game Spanish media wondered if the international break had happened at just the wrong time for Barcelona and just the right time for Real Madrid – something reflected in Madrid’s big win at lunchtime. The Frenchman wheels away in celebration of his second half header at the Balaidos Stadium . Gerard Pique (right) and Sergio Busquets join the French defender in celebration of his goal . With Los Blancos in disarray, a couple of weeks spent healing wounds away from the Santiago Bernabeu seemed an agreeable plan, while Barcelona's momentum was disrupted. Jordi Alba was injured playing for Spain, so Adriano Correia started in his stead. Messi, meanwhile, was dragged round the United States with Argentina, sidelined because of an inflamed foot which left him unable to put his boots on. He managed to do that here, but his presence was barely noticed on the pitch. With rival Cristiano Ronaldo scoring an incredible five goals earlier, Messi was left frustrated in his quest for the golden boot, with the Madrid man four strikes ahead of him on 36. Luis Enrique hasn't shown himself to be the sentimental type, but the former Celta Vigo manager gave Rafinha Alcantara a rare start against the team which he played for, both before moving to Barcelona at 13, and last season on loan. However, the midfielder failed to impress and made way for the legendary Xavi early in the second half. Mathieu (left) is congratulated by team-mates Lionel Messi and Neymar (right) after his goal . Javier Mascherano was suspended for accumulating too many yellow cards, as is his wont, but luckily for Barcelona Busquets was fit enough to start for the first time in over a month. Alvarez turned in the display of his life at the Camp Nou and Barcelona's attacking trident must have worried it was going to happen again, when he made a brilliant diving stop to deny Lionel Messi. Profligacy was an issue in that 1-0 defeat too, which we were reminded of when Neymar slashed the rebound high and wide. Los Celestes had made the early running themselves and Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who boasts the best defensive record in La Liga, was down quickly to deny Joaquin Larrivey at his near post. It was Larrivey that put the first goal of the season past Bravo at the Camp Nou and he was determined not to let the Celta forward in again. With Messi quiet, it was down to the other two prongs of Barcelona's trident to try and make inroads. Neither were successful. Fabian\\xa0Orellana was shown a red card for throwing a chunk of grass in the direction of Sergio Busquets . The lump of turf strikes Busquets in the neck after tempers reached boiling point . Neymar antagonised the Celta Vigo fans as he drew several fouls, but the Barcelona ones too with his incredible wastefulness. To watch him in recent weeks is to see a different player to the one that dismantled La Liga defences earlier in the season. His first touch was frequently poor, his passes off-target. Suarez, meanwhile, went down in the box looking for a penalty under an arm from Gustavo Cabral, but far too little contact to actually tumble. He was then booked on the stroke of half-time for a dive, although this time he has been charged into. The one opportunity Suarez got he hit hard and true, stinging the palms of Alvarez. But Celta Vigo were on top and Nolito was getting the better of Dani Alves time and time again. Maybe the Brazilian's mind is elsewhere, with his contract expiring in the summer, but physically he seems less capable too. Orellana (right) leaves the field after referee\\xa0Inaki Vicandi Garrido brandishes a red card . The Barcelona players surround referee following a controversial decision . One horrendous defensive mix-up left Nolito charging for the ball with Bravo. The keeper got his foot to it before colliding with the Celta Vigo man, but the fans screamed for a penalty, unsuccessfully. The offside flag being raised against Orellana led to a Celta goal being ruled out, but the best chance fell to Larrivey before the interval. Orellana cut the ball neatly across the box but the striker, unmarked, nine yards out, lacked composure, hacking at it and sending it into the Vigo night sky. Barcelona continued to struggle, with Neymar’s goal harshly ruled out for offside and a shanked Alves shot the only efforts to their credit. Messi and Neymar react after another missed opportunity during a frustrating evening for the duo . Then came Pique’s tackle on Charles, with the defender making a super-human effort to get back and deny the striker. Celta Vigo were almost instantly punished for it, with Mathieu breaking the deadlock. Barcelona couldn’t kill the game, even after Orellana’s late sending off, with Messi scooping the ball over Alvarez but inches over the crossbar too. It didn’t matter; they held on to earn the three points and maintain the four-point lead over Real Madrid that they started the week with. And one game less for each side to play. It’s not pretty, it’s not ‘the Barca way’, but if Enrique lifts La Liga, nobody will be worrying about that.

Former Celtic star Hooper's goal sparked jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench in contrast to the dejection of his one-time Parkhead boss Neil Lennon. Indeed, Hooper had been a transfer target for Lennon earlier in the season so his winning goal was a double blow for the Ulsterman.

Graham Dorrans gave the Canaries an early lead as his right-footed free-kick deflected off Josh Vela into the net, but Adam Le Fondre looked to have rescued a point and extended Bolton's unbeaten run to four games. Instead, Hooper lobbed keeper Adam Bogdan - as the Wanderers defenders switched off - to score an invaluable goal. Lennon had promised his side would spoil a few parties in the remaining games of the season with Brantford and Bournemouth coming up in the next few weeks. That looked to be the case until Hooper's strike made it five wins in the last six meetings between the teams. Norwich made the perfect start with Dorrans' deflected free-kick after Vela took down Nathan Redmond on the edge of the area. The Canaries should have doubled their advantage six minutes later as Sebastien Bassong rose highest at a corner but cleared Bogdan's crossbar by some distance. Hooper lobs the ball over Adam Bogdan to spark jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench . Former West Brom midfielder Graham DOrrans celebrates after giving the visitors the lead on Saturday . And the visitors were in total control when Wanderers drew level totally against the run of play. It was so one-sided manager Lennon was poised to bring on Neil Danns to shore up his midfield. Instead, youngster Tom Walker, who had been guilty of delaying a cross moments earlier, learned his lesson. His flashing centre from the left picked out Le Fondre inside the six-yard box and the on-loan Cardiff City striker, back in the side after missing the Easter Monday trip to South Wales, finished with ease. Walker continued to prove a threat to the visitors' defence with his elusive running and was harshly booked for a foul on Wes Hoolahan. Liam Feeney shot narrowly wide from another Walker cross that fizzed beyond three static Norwich defenders before the Canaries rediscovered their composure. Top scorer Cameron Jerome, whose double won the reverse fixture at Carrow Road last October, brought a smart save out of Bogdan while the Hungarian international needed treatment after punching away another dangerous-looking Dorrans free-kick. Norwich striker Cameron Jerome heads towards goal during the clash at the Macron Stadium . The second half was much more competitive and Wanderers were more of a match for their high flying visitors. So much so that Neil brought on Lewis Grabban after 57 minutes for Hoolahan. And Grabban made an immediate impact, bringing out a save from Bogdan before Tim Ream cleared off the line from first-half scorer Dorrans. However, Bolton had their moments going forward too with Le Fondre trying cheekily to chip John Ruddy while Alex Tettey cleared off the line after Dorian Dervite narrowly failed to connect with Walker's corner. Neil's intention's were clear and with 20 minutes left had made his full set of substitutions with Hooper replacing Nathan Redmond and Steven Whittaker going off for Ryan Bennett. The visitors were incensed they did not get a penalty when Russell Martin's cross hit Dean Moxey on the hand.

Sentencing Hernandez was no easy decision to come to for the jury who heard from 130 witnesses and reviewed 400 pieces of evidence since the trial started at the end of January. The group deliberated for 35 hours over the course of a week, and decided that certain aspects of victim Odin Lloyd\\'s killing warranted a life in prison without the possibility of parole sentence - the highest sentence possible in the state of Massachusetts where the death penalty is outlawed. Many of the jurors pointed to the fact that Lloyd had been shot six times as evidence of the callousness of the crime. At the time of his death, Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez\\'s fianceé. \\'You shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times. There\\'s no need for that and there\\'s no need to use a gun. Period,\\' jury foreman Lesa Strachan said. Other jurors were shocked by Hernandez\\'s casual behavior, sunbathing with friends just a few hours after Lloyd is suspected to have been murdered. Directly after court on Wednesday, Hernandez was taken to a prison just two miles from Gillette Stadium, where he traded his  $1.3million mansion for a small cell and a pair of gray scrubs. The jurors will now be allowed to return to their day jobs, but they say the time they spent on the jury will stay with them forever. Oliver and other jurors say friends have been calling them up to congratulate them after the verdict - something that has left them speechless. \\'Who won? Odin Lloyd didn\\'t win. (His mother) didn\\'t bring back her son. Did Mr. Hernandez win? No, because he\\'s going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he\\'s 25 years old. The worst part for me is: How about that little girl that\\'s never going to see her father again?\\' Oliver said.', 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.7377577424049377, 0.26224231719970703]}\n",

            "{'sequence': \"The records are tumbling and Leicester’s belief is growing. Their 2-0 victory over Swansea made it three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000, lifting Nigel Pearson’s side to 17th and ending their five-month spell at the bottom. All this after just two wins in their previous 24 games. Most looking at the club reasoned relegation would be a matter of time. Instead, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley, Hull and Sunderland are now shorter odds to go down with bookmakers. In truth, there have been no significant changes to affect results. Pearson has applied the same principles throughout the season, except now Leicester are taking more chances. Here Sportsmail assesses the key themes of Leicester’s revival. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after scoring against Swansea during his side's 2-0 win . Scoring surge . Andy King’s late tap-in meant Leicester have scored two or more goals in a fourth consecutive top-flight match for the first time since May 2000. Previously, Leicester were creating plenty but fluffing their lines. Against Crystal Palace in February, for example, they had five shots on target, eight shots off target, six shots blocked – and failed to find the net, losing 1-0. They had six shots on target against Swansea, with a much better success rate. Andy King scores Leicester's second goal to seal three points against Swansea at the King Power Stadium . Cambiasso class . Ulloa scored his first Premier League goal in 647 minutes; last scoring on Boxing Day 2014. Esteban Cambiasso will surely be named Leicester’s player of the season come what may. The Argentine has sprinkled high quality to their midfield, winning possession and conducting play like a grand master plots chess moves. At 34, his experience is now shining through – a calm head even as circumstances appeared brittle. His goal to set up the win over West Ham was special too. His pass completion was not outstanding against Swansea – just 68.3 per cent – but that is largely because he tried difficult balls to get his team on the front foot. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso puts in another classy performance against Swansea on Saturday . Schmeichel sensational . With the score at 1-0, Swansea unlocked the Leicester defence to send Nelson Oliveira through on goal. Kasper Schmeichel was out in a flash, spreading himself large and deflecting the finish wide. It was a hugely important moment. The Danish goalkeeper was on the sidelines with a broken metatarsal for more than three months of this season, but has returned at peak form for this crucial period. Foxes goalkeeper\\xa0Kasper Schmeichel gets down quickly and makes himself big to save from Nelson Oliveria . Adept at adapting . Aside from Schmeichel’s injury, Pearson has been able to call a mainly full-strength squad most weeks. He has changed personnel – only Wes Morgan has more than 30 starts under his belt – and players appear fresh when other squads may be tiring. He is flexible with his tactics, changing during games to suit the situation. He is getting it right recently. Against West Bromwich Albion he began with 4-3-1-2 but switched to 3-5-2 when trailing at half-time. Against Swansea, he started with an attacking 3-4-1-2 but implemented a back four when ahead. King slides in with a strong challenge on Swansea's\\xa0Oliveria during the Premier League match on Saturday . Pearson’s strength . The Leicester manager has been on the touchline rather than high in the stands recently, and uses his position to effect rather than for show. He kept players motivated at the Hawthorns and used a break in play against Swansea to give an impromptu team talk. He has been in remarkable survivals before, at Carlisle, Southampton, and West Brom, and knows what is required. He has managed to keep the respect of the squad through his imposing personality even after the phantom sacking. The players have always supported him. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson gives instructions to his players ahead of the 2-0 win over Swansea . Belief building . The great escape theme was hummed loudly by Leicester fans at fullt-time, and atmospheres at the King Power Stadium have been very noisy for the wins over West Ham and Swansea. That will continue for four of the final six games, with home comfort looking vital. Burnley at Turf Moor awaits first, and Leonardo Ulloa, who scored the opening goal, insists Leicester must not let their intensity dip. He also thinks Leicester’s sustained spell in the relegation zone has equipped them with the psychological tools to claw their way up. ‘If you know this situation at the bottom you play different, the mentality is a little different,’ he said. ‘Now with a good result and we have to push on.’ A Leicester fan holds up a sign backing the team to win their battle against relegation this season .\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.7450053095817566, 0.2549947500228882]}\n",
            "{'sequence': \"Manchester City bounced back from their recent 4-2 derby defeat by easing to victory against West Ham. An own goal by James Collins and Sergio Aguero's 20th Barclays Premier League strike of the season was enough to give City the three points. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates the players' performances at the Etihad Stadium. MANCHESTER CITY (4-2-3-1) JOE HART 6 -\\xa0The England goalkeeper couldn’t have wished for a quieter 28th birthday, and was rarely called into action by a toothless West Ham. PABLO ZABALETA\\xa06.5 – Treated for bloody nose early on but that was about the extent of the damage inflicted on City. Got forward well as usual. Manchester City right back Pablo Zabaleta keeps Enner Valencia at bay by putting in a crunching challenge . MARTIN DEMICHELIS\\xa06 – Careless slip let in Carlton Cole in the first half but otherwise looked relatively comfortable alongside a new defensive partner in Mangala. ELIAQUIM MANGALA 7 - Dominant display from City’s £32million defender who was able to enjoy a trouble-free return to the line-up, and snuffed out the few threats offered by the Hammers. ALEKSANDAR KOLAROV\\xa06.5 – Went close with slightly deflected freekick and another effort from a tight angle in the second half. Defensively, faced little threat from Valencia. FRANK LAMPARD\\xa06 – Only his fifth Premier League start for City and of lack match sharpness showed on occasions as his touch let him down. Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard was given a rare chance to impress by starting against West Ham . FERNANDO\\xa06.5 – Didn’t have too much on his plate but was alert to track Kouyate’s burst from midfield in the first half and produced a fantastic interception tackle. JESUS NAVAS\\xa08 – Much better from the little Spaniard. More direct and looked for an earlier pass, which contributed to both of City’s first two goals. Jesus Navas played a major role in Manchester City's two goals at the Etihad Stadium . YAYA TOURE\\xa07 – A more lively display than of late from the much-maligned Ivorian who passed the ball well and his interception started the move for City’s second goal. DAVID SILVA\\xa06.5 – Subdued display despite going close with a couple of efforts, and stretchered off following lengthy treatment after taking an elbow to the head from Kouyate. SERGIO AGUERO 7.5 – The Argentine’s third goal in two games took his total to 26 for the season, and the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 20. Can’t argue with that. Sergio Aguero celebrates with City team-mates Navas and Yaya Toure after putting his side 2-0 up . Manchester City ace Sergio Aguero wheels away in celebration after scoring his 20th Premier League goal . Subs: Caballero, Sagna, Boyata, Fernandinho (for Lampard 88), Nasri (for Silva 75, 6), Dzeko (for Aguero 90+1), Pozo. Scorers: Collins og 18, Aguero 36 . Booked: Navas, Silva . WEST HAM (4-1-4-1) ADRIAN\\xa06 – Had little chance with either of City’s goals, particularly Collins’s own-goal which looped over his head and in off the underside of the bar. CARL JENKINSON\\xa06 – One of West Ham’s better defenders and produced an excellent interception to deny Aguero an almost certain goal in the second half. JAMES COLLINS\\xa05 – Won’t enjoy seeing a replay of his freakish own-goal. Almost redeemed himself with a great block on Silva – but not quite. West Ham centre back James Collins diverted the ball past Adrian to give Manchester City an early lead . WINSTON REID 5.5 – Did his best to hold City at bay but guilty of an awful dive in the dying stages that was thankfully ignored by the referee and ridiculed by the City fans. AARON CRESSWELL 5.5 – After his goalscoring exploits against Stoke last weekend, had a difficult afternoon up against Navas and struggled to cope at times. ALEX SONG 5 – Had his hands full trying to screen West ham’s defence against the blue tide in the first half and replaced by Jarvis as Big Sam tried to salvage something in the second. Alex Song, pictured with Lampard, was replaced by manager Sam Allardyce in the 66th minute . CHEIKHOU KOUYATE 6 – His arm into Silva’s face was the talking point of a dull game. It seemed to be more careless than malicious but City may think otherwise. MARK NOBLE 5 – Overrun in midfield and was able to offer his team very little. Struggled tpo get into the game at all. STEWART DOWNING 4.5 – Lost the ball in the build-up to City’s second goal and that summed up his performance. Below-par and lacked any impact at all. ENNER VALENCIA 6 – Anonymous in the first half but picked up a bit after the interval and had West Ham’s best effort with a fine individual run and shot. CARLTON COLE 4.5 – Was gifted the Hammers’ best opportunity in the first half but took too long to get a shot off. Struggled with little service and replaced by Nolan. Carlton Cole failed to impress on his first start  since his side's 0-0 draw with Southampton in February . Subs: Nolan (for Cole 66, 6), Jarvis (for Song 66, 6), Nene, O’Brien, Amalfitano, Jaaskelainen, Burke. Booked: Kouyate, Downing . Referee: Anthony Taylor 6.5 .

On Tuesday, SpaceX came incredibly close to landing its Falcon 9 rocket booster on a barge in the middle of the Atlantic. Now, leaked footage reveals just how close Elon Musk's firm came to success, with a close-up view of the daring attempt shot on a GoPro camera . A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster caused by a gust of wind. The video, which appeared on Reddit, reveals how the rocket overcompensates for its extreme tilt. A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve designed to control the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster. Earlier this week SpaceX has released its own dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the Atlantic. The video, taken from a plane , shows the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before exploding on impact. The maneuver was attempted following the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket a few minutes earlier from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Soon after the launch, billionaire SpaceX founder, Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.' The unverified video shows the rocket drifting into view in slow motion and floating onto its target before a gust of wind topples it over . Pictured is the moment of impact. \\xa0A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.'\\xa0This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough . Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. The autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft (90 by 30 metres), with wings that extend its width to 170ft (50 metres). Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. The Falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing and science experiments to the ISS - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts. The supplies today arrived at the ISS. The rocket was was due to take off on Monday, but the launch was  scrubbed due to bad weather. The video, taken from a plane on Tuesday, shows the the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side . On board the Dragon capsule was an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. 'We're very, very happy to have it here,' Cristoforetti radioed to mission controllers in Houston today. The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee-drinking in space. SpaceX, meanwhile, hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. The booster managed to land on the barge but Elon Musk said that 'excess lateral velocity' caused it to tip over . Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year . The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic ocean . Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions.' The Dragon — the only supply ship capable of returning items intact — will remain at the space station until around May 21. During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery of food and equipment arrived today . The launch sequence as it happened. All stages of the launch went to plan, except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket.\\xa0SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand . Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed second landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. This is the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit. The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying. The Falcon Heavy is expected to make its first test flight late this year. While the booster landing didn't go to plane, the launch was successful. It took place at 4.10 ET from Florida under perfect conditions, after a attempt had to be scrubbed on Monday due to lightning .\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.7120190858840942, 0.28798097372055054]}\n",

During a 2011 incident involving two guns when he playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Talib and his mother were accused of shooting a gun at his sister's live-in boyfriend in Garland, Texas. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother Yaqub are being investigated for aggravated assault . Talib was in trouble before and was wanted on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 2011 . During the latest incident, a shot was fired outside of Club Luxx in Dallas, Texas, after a physical fight inside . During the incident on Wednesday, Talib and his brother Yaqub had a physical altercation with someone inside Club Luxx and then a shot was fired outside around 2am,\\xa0WFAA reported. When Dallas officers responded to the active shooter call, the man who called police said three black men had been involved in a disturbance and one of them had tried to punch him. The man also said one of the men pulled out a gun and aimed it at him before firing a round off into the sky outside the bar and causing 'an immediate panic'. The Talibs left the area in a Range Rover and a Jaguar and went to the XTC Cabaret. Police found the brothers at the second club and impounded the vehicles to look for evidence. The brothers were both questioned and an investigation into the incident is ongoing. The general manager of Club Luxx, confirmed the Talibs were at the club but denied that anything with a gun transpired, the\\xa0Dallas Morning News reported. Hanney Kamal said: 'One-hundred percent that did not happen. 'I was there. Somebody might have called the police because there was a yelling argument. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract last year . 'It's athletes — someone sees them yelling and dials 911. 'Everyone was asked to leave the club, which they did of their own free will, and that was it.' Broncos vice president of public relations Patrick Smyth said: 'We have been in touch with Aqib regarding these reports and will continue to monitor this situation.' Dallas police falsely reported Talib had been arrested for throwing bottles last June during an NFL camp afterparty, the\\xa0Denver Post\\xa0reported. The police apologized after it ended up being Yaqub who was arrested. During the 2011 incident in Garland, felony warrants were issued for Talib and his mother Okolo Talib on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police suspected them both of firing shots from a Ruger .380 handgun at\\xa0Shannon Billings, the boyfriend of Talib's sister, and also believed the NFL back\\xa0attempted to pistol-whip Billings with a Springfield 9mm semiautomatic handgun during the incident, the Boston Globe\\xa0reported. They had apparently learned Billings was being physically abusive towards their family member. Talib, who owned both weapons. reportedly yelled during the pistol-whipping: 'You're going to make me throw away my career.' The charges were dropped because prosecutors believed Billings, a registered sex offender with the state of Texas, would not make a credible witness. Garland Police spokesman Joe Harn said: 'It was very fortunate no one was killed and no one was hurt seriously. 'There wasn't a great deal of distance from one person to the other that was shooting.' After the 2011 incident, a felony warrant was issued for  Okolo Talib for assault with a deadly weapon charge . In addition to playing for the Broncos, Talib has also played for the Patriots and the Buccaneers . In addition to the gun incidents, Talib was investigated after an alleged assault on a Florida cab driver. He then resisted arrest on charges of simple battery. The shutdown corner also fought with teammates and was suspended for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract with Denver in March 2014. He also has played for the New England Patriots during his seven-year career. During his time with the reigning Super Bowl champs, Talib said: 'I'm a competitor on the field, man. 'That's kind of what we're talking about right now, just football.' If charges are brought with regard to the incident in Dallas, Talib could face discipline under the NFL's personal conduct policy and a suspension seems possible given his history.

            "{'sequence': \"Two goals within ninety seconds of each other was enough to spark an outbreak of fear and loathing rarely seen on this side of the Mersey. After more than two years of inexorable decline the patience of Tranmere's faithful finally snapped when Oxford moved decisively ahead, in an effortless manner reminiscent of the previous Saturday's Boat Race. The loathing was directed mainly at manager Micky Adams, who was announced on Sunday morning to have left the club by 'mutual consent'. The Tranmere players look down after the final whistle, as the prospect of relegation looms large . This is how it ends in football sometimes: standing in the dugout having a season ticket thrown in your face by an incandescent supporter, who you then see given a standing ovation by some sections upon being escorted out. The fear involves dropping out of the Football League a week on Saturday after 94 years of membership, something which provoked an angry demonstration by some 150 supporters outside the gates afterwards. Adams departs with two games to go and after a 3-0 defeat against a thoroughly professional Oxford side the Wirral's only professional sports outfit are one point behind Cheltenham and two behind Hartlepool. Bitter ironies abound. Relegation to the National League – the grand-sounding new title for the Conference but don't be fooled – may partly be down to Prenton Park legend and ex-manager Ronnie Moore, sacked by the club last season for a minor betting offence, and now masterminding Hartlepool's unlikely survival. And it could all happen under the ownership of former FA Chief Executive Mark Palios, knowledgeable football man and esteemed former Tranmere player who took over the club late last summer. Kemar Roofe celebrates scoring, as a professional Oxford side eased past sorry Tranmere . The battle between Barnet and Bristol Rovers to win automatic promotion to the Football League will go down to the last game. Barnet, who lead the Conference by one point, have a home game against mid-table Gateshead on Saturday while Rovers face a potentially more difficult match at home against fourth from bottom Alfreton, who almost certainly need to win themselves to avoid being relegated. Rovers looked as if they would head the table after the weekend’s games but conceded a goal with two minutes left to draw 1-1 at Dover. That put Barnet, who dropped out of the Football League two seasons ago, in the driving seat after a 1-1 draw away to Kidderminster. Grimsby are guaranteed a play-off spot, but one of Eastleigh, Forest Green and Macclesfield will miss out. It all seemed such a good idea at the time. Nobody questioned his judgement in October when, with the team bottom of the table, he replaced the inexperienced Rob Edwards with a seasoned operator like Adams. There was the odd dead cat bounce, but six months on they are still bottom after failing to keep a clean sheet for nineteen consecutive matches. The Mersey ferry displays a quicker turning circle than that shown by the home defence for the two killer goals that came just after half-time, but then a cause of that may be a lack of familiarity among players. A staggering 52 have been called up to first team duty this season. Adams played the selection and recruitment game like a man on the fruit machine, continually pulling the handle in the hope that the right combination would come up in alignment. The latest loan signing has been young Everton winger George Green who, when pulled off on Saturday after 60 minutes, could be seen haranguing some of his team-mates on the bench. It was not long after full-time that you could catch assistant manager Alan Rogers, part of a distinguished list of former Tranmere players who graduated to a higher level, stripping the paint from the dressing room walls. Micky Adams has left the club by mutual consent, with Tranmere bottom of the league with two games to go . Rogers – now in charge for the next fortnight – then had to deny that Adams's decision to dodge the media was of any significance. He then professed himself 'dumbfounded' by the team's performance. And so it unravels in desperate times. They had actually competed gamely in the first half, but were overwhelmed by anxiety when getting anywhere near the goal. 'It's not acceptable,' he said. 'We just don't look like scoring a goal. The players have got to start taking some responsibility. It's an easy option pointing fingers at the manager but the players have got to look at themselves, have they done enough? The answer is no. I was a player. You've got to stand up and be counted.' Marc Laird, well-travelled journeyman and among those fighting for his career, did not try to shift the blame onto the management. He just about summed up the sense of disbelief saying: 'It's a big club, when I joined in the summer I never imagined that we would be where we are.' The prospect of dropping out of the 92 is something uniquely grim in English football, especially for a club of this heritage, who shortly after joining the league gave a debut to 16 year-old local lad Dixie Dean. It was only in January 2013 that they stood on top of League One and early in the last decade reached the League Cup final plus three FA Cup sixth rounds. But they do not have to look far for examples of how there is no easy road back in the event of relegation. Aside from Southport and Chester there is Wrexham, not far across the Welsh border and a decent sized club, who fell out of the league in 2008 and have yet to return. There is a long trip to Plymouth next Saturday and then a last home game against Bury. The unpalatable odds are that the next stop after that could be somewhere like Braintree or Dover.\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.517632782459259, 0.48236727714538574]}\n",

Richie Benaud, pictured  in January 2013, has died \\xa0at the age of 84 after a battle with skin cancer . Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Tributes are seen at the statue of Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing . It was said he would regularly file 700 or 800 words, of which maybe 150 or 200 would see the light of day. But, a professional to his core, Benaud kept on filing. He loved cricket, and he loved conveying his love, by visual means or verbal. That much was evident during his playing days. He won 63 Test caps between January 1952 and February 1964, collecting 248 wickets with his leg-spin (at a very good average of 27) and scoring 2,201 runs at 24. But it was the style as much as the stats. It was often an understated era, typified by Jim Laker’s steadfast refusal to celebrate any of the 19 wickets he took against Australia at Old Trafford in 1956 (Benaud c Statham b Laker 0; Benaud b Laker 18). Benaud did his best to change all that. Sport was fun, emotional and human: if he got a wicket, he’d do more than hitch his trousers up, Laker-style. He’d whoop and skip and jump: take a look on YouTube at him enjoying Bob Simpson’s slip catch at Old Trafford in 1961, where his leg-breaks spirited Australia to a come-from-behind win. These days players go further than that. But Benaud was their spiritual forefather. He loved not just cricket, but cricketers too. Not everyone was enamoured by his involvement in Kerry Packer’s rebellious World Series Cricket in the late 1970s. But WSC eventually forced the Establishment’s hand. Cricketers were soon paid a living wage, not the honorariums they had previously endured. Benaud’s involvement and influence were central to that. It was as a TV commentator that Benaud came into his own. When Wisden asked him in 2003 to dispense some advice to aspiring broadcasters, he suggested: ‘Put your brain into gear before opening your mouth.’ That style – laconic, considered, dry – would become his hallmark, together with an unfailing greeting: ‘Good morning, everyone.’ When Benaud welcomed viewers, they were able to relax: the cricket was about to begin. There were times when you might have longed for him to express himself more trenchantly, to air his opinions more clearly. Surely, you wondered, he must have felt strongly about subjects other than the front-foot no-ball law. But it was not his style – and he remained true to himself. ‘Above all,’ he told Wisden, ‘when commentating, don’t take yourself too seriously, and have fun.’ Benaud was Australia captain and  the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests . After his playing career, Benaud forged an incredibly successful career as a cricket commentator . Benaud (right) in discussion with England's Michael Vaughan ahead of a Test match in 2004 . That last tip has been cheerfully taken on board by the current generation of Channel Nine commentators in Australia. And if they have been less adept at putting their brains into gear before opening their mouths, then that also reflects the almost impossibly high standards set by Benaud himself. His successors were always going to pale by comparison. Behind it all was a quiet, imposing strength. The first time I met him, Benaud almost broke my fingers with his handshake. As a friend noted: ‘You don’t get to captain Australia with a limp wrist.’ Good night, everyone.\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.676200807094574, 0.32379916310310364]}\n",

'He lost, once to man who'd only had seven fights previously. I'm undefeated. He called himself The Greatest so I call myself The Best Ever. I knew there would be a back-lash but I couldn't care less. 'He said he was greater than Sugar Ray Robinson and someone else will come along in the future to be criticised for believing he's the best.' The God question did not faze him: 'I also believe in God. I've been blessed in my life. I love God and I don't believe God takes sides (in fights).

'His fighter is not talking like that and it's only me and Pacquiao who will do the fighting. I wish Freddie well.' The new, considerate Floyd choked up a little when asked about important influences who had inspired him to greatness. He took us back to Grand Rapids and a certain Mr Frank Brown, saying: 'He was important to me from the age of three, Like a grandfather. He would drive me to fights in my amateur days (no Money back then). Sometimes hundreds of miles. He believed in me more than anyone. He told me I'd make it. He took me to church. 'He came to so many of my fights right up to Oscar De La Hoya. But he's not doing well now. He's in an old folks home. He's losing his memory. It hurts. I love the guy so much. I think about him every day.' It went quiet for a moment on the line. It seemed like a good time to ask why he had changed from cocksure to contemplative almost to the point of silence.

And he welcomes the challenge which some think threatens his unbeaten legacy: 'I respect Manny Pacquaio. To be here now he must be doing something right. 'We reached the point where this fight had to happen. He's one of the last great fighters of our time left for me to defeat. I'm glad it's happening.'

            "{'sequence': 'TESTOSTERONE . by Joe Herbert . (OUP £16.99) Testosterone doesn’t always get a good press. Everything that’s unpleasant about male behaviour has been ascribed to the effects of this much maligned hormone. Violence? It’s all testosterone’s fault. Sexual assault and rape? Just blame testosterone. Yet, as Joe Herbert makes clear in his engaging whistlestop tour of the science surrounding it, testosterone is at the heart of human life. ‘Without our father’s testosterone,’ as he writes, ‘none of us would exist.’ It has only one basic function — to enable a male to reproduce, and for that it’s essential. Although this is the case and it’s impossible to think of ‘maleness’ without testosterone, it’s also important for sexual behaviour in women. The blood of an adult woman before menopause actually contains about five times more testosterone than oestrogen, the supposedly ‘female’ hormone. However, it’s as a metaphor for masculinity that testosterone is best known. All that’s unpleasant about male behaviour is ascribed to testosterone, yet as Joe Herbert explains, testosterone is at the heart of human life . It begins its influence in the womb as it helps to shape the distinctive characteristics of the male body. This influence continues immediately after birth. That three-month-old baby boy, sweetly smiling at you from his pram, may well have testosterone levels that rival his father’s. We don’t know why but, starting two weeks after birth and lasting for four to six months, a little boy’s testes are producing testosterone in substantial amounts. The hormone’s power then recedes, but returns — and how! — in puberty. Post-puberty, testosterone drives the competition for females. In the animal world, stags lock antlers, elephants enter the aggressive state known as musth and male rhinos go horn-to-horn. Even male giraffes, aroused by the hormone’s influence, flail at one another with their long necks. Elaborate colourings emerge in some species, designed to emphasise masculinity and attract female attention. In guenon monkeys the scrotum turns bright blue. They don’t seem to mind. They adopt the habit of sitting with their legs apart to show the female guenons just how big and blue they are. We can only be thankful that testosterone’s effects on sexual display in humans are not so visually dramatic. Adult human males have varying levels of the hormone in different circumstances. Entirely unsurprisingly, having sex increases testosterone levels. So, too, does talking to an attractive woman and watching pornographic movies. Winning at sports sends the levels racing upwards. Just supporting a winning team can have the same effect. It works in politics as well. A study showed that, during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, Barack Obama supporters were pumped full of testosterone. Levels fell in the supporters of his defeated rival, John McCain. Testosterone also helps in the City. Another study, on a London trading floor, showed that male traders made more money on days on which their morning testosterone levels were higher than usual. A challenge is obviously stimulating. Surgeons facing difficult procedures often find their testosterone levels shooting up. One would assume that the theatre of war would have the same effect as the operating theatre, if not more so. After all, testosterone is supposed to be the hormone behind violence and aggression. In fact, soldiers in the heat of battle can have testosterone levels not much above those of men who have been castrated. It’s the appalling stress that reduces it. Once they leave the front line, however, the soldiers revert to more normal levels. When levels are high, the effects of testosterone on male behaviour are so strong that the human brain has had to find a multitude of ways of regulating and channelling them. The creation of laws, religion and customs has, to some extent, been shaped by the need to do so. In that sense, as Joe Herbert writes, ‘testosterone lies at the heart of much of our history’. His own fascination with the ‘simple but wondrous chemical’ that is his subject is clear. His book does a fine job of conveying that fascination to the rest of us.', 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.7735189199447632, 0.2264811247587204]}\n",

The difference between the first and the second half was like night and day. When Carrick came on, England started to play. Having played in his position, and alongside him, it has been frustrating to see him unappreciated in this country. We have always had a major problem keeping the ball, but Carrick keeps the game simple. That’s exactly what we need. Roy Hodgson’s team against Italy looked like he had one eye on the future, but the only future England need to be focusing on is Euro 2016. If that means going with a 34-year-old Michael Carrick in the heart of midfield, so be it. Tuesday night's friendly clash with Italy  could prove to be Michael Carrick's most important England game . England international Carrick keeps the game simple but has been unappreciated in this country . Carrick congratulates Andros Townsend following the Tottenham wideman's equaliser against Italy in Turin . WAYNE ROONEY . ‘The best player on the pitch by a mile was Michael Carrick. He came on and dictated the game for us.’ PAUL SCHOLES (last week) ‘He is not a flash footballer. He doesn’t hit Hollywood passes. He doesn’t score lots of goals. But I loved playing alongside him.’ SIR ALEX FERGUSON (in December) ‘I still think Michael Carrick is the best central midfield player in English football, I really do. I think he is the best English player in the game.’ Even though he’s 33 now, it’s still not too late to start building the midfield around him. If I were England manager, that’s just what I’d do. Look at Andrea Pirlo — he is 36 next month and has blossomed in his later years. His passing tore England apart at the World Cup and he is worshipped in Italy. Why can’t we love Carrick in the same way? The fact he has been ignored by England for so long is a sad indictment of where we have been going wrong for so many years. In this country we tend to focus a lot on what players can’t do rather than what they can. We love all-action players like Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard but that’s why men like Carrick can be left frustrated. It was not long ago that defensive midfielders had to snap into every tackle. At Manchester United in particular, Carrick has had to deal with ‘Keane Syndrome’ — because he’s not Roy Keane. He’s not as mobile, he doesn’t grab games in the same way and he certainly doesn’t tackle like Keane. But that is not his style. Keane was an amazing player but there will never be another like him and the game has evolved. Carrick and Ryan Mason (left) applaud the travelling England support following Tuesday's 1-1 draw with Italy . Fans love all-action players like former England midfield stars Frank Lampard (left) and Steven Gerrard . Andrea Pirlo, who turns 36 next month, tore England apart with his passing at last summer's World Cup . The best deep-lying midfielders of recent years have been passers, not pit bulls: Pirlo, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, Sergio Busquets. All of them are cultured players who look after the ball. And don’t be fooled by a powerhouse like Nemanja Matic — he can pick out any kind of pass with that left foot. These aren’t just defensive destroyers any more, these are the men starting the attacks. They may not have the best stats for goals or assists, but they are at the heart of it all. It’s the same with Andres Iniesta and Luka Modric — they keep things ticking over, as does Carrick. He makes the passes that lead to the key pass. The midfield that started in Turin was powerful and athletic, but sometimes you need a bit of guile. In a way, it was a good job the first half was so poor as it meant Carrick could come on and really show what he can do. Friendlies might be a good time to experiment but that first half in Italy made for some uncomfortable viewing. Phil Jones has had a decent season at centre back but looked awkward in midfield and England’s passing was too slow and square. Carrick changed that. All of a sudden there was a different tempo to the game. England were fluid and found more room to move against a tough opponent. When he gets possession, Carrick quickly gets the ball out of his feet and tries to slide passes forward. He’s not the toughest of tacklers but he doesn’t need to be. He reads the game brilliantly and intercepts the ball so well that he doesn’t need to go charging after people. He has fantastic vision, which means his team-mates can get into dangerous positions. They know that if anyone can pick out a pass, it’s Carrick. He is so comfortable on the ball and probably England’s most two-footed player since Glenn Hoddle. He’s not in Hoddle’s class, but he is so well balanced with both feet. Carrick takes on midfield rival Roberto Soriano during England's 1-1 draw with Italy at the Juventus Stadium . Xavi and Nemanja Matic are two of the world's best deep-lying midfielders and both have an eye for a pass . Carrick's introduction against Italy changed the game, the tempo and saw England become more fluid . I’ve said it before but Carrick has a nasty habit of passing to his own players. It might not look flash but he makes the game look easy. That’s why so many of his team-mates love playing alongside him. He might be a quiet personality but you can see the effect he has on those around him. United have been far better with him than without him this season and Daley Blind, who many thought would replace him, has been shunted out of position. That’s because Carrick is a better player in that role. It’s also important to have experience in that position — I’ve never felt it’s one for a young player. Hodgson has tried Jack Wilshere but Carrick knows the role at club level. Of course Wilshere could play next to him, but at present Carrick is the best man for the job. Considering he won his first cap against Mexico in 2001, it’s amazing he has not featured more for England. He has not always taken his chances, but now is a golden opportunity to build our midfield around him. It’s still not too late to make sure England have a pass master in place for Euro 2016. Carrick, who made his debut in 2001 (right), could become England's third-longest serving player at the Euros .\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.6261598467826843, 0.37384018301963806]}\n",
            "{'sequence': \"Modern humans have been blamed for killing off the Neanderthals by out competing them, breeding with them and even outright murdering them. But new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of Africa that finished them off. Scientists studying the latest genetic, fossil and archaeological evidence claim that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today. Scroll down for video . Neanderthals, like the reconstruction above on display at the Natural History Museum in London, may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to Europe by modern humans as they migrated out of Africa . They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World. Another recent genetic study by scientists at the University at Buffalo has suggested that Neanderthals may have suffered from psoriasis and Crohn's disease, a condition that affects the digestive system. They speculate that pathogens like Heliocbacter pylori, the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers, were brought to Europe by modern humans from Africa and may have infected Neanderthals, who would have been unable to fight off these new diseases. However, Neandethals may have also helped modern humans by passing on slivers of immunity against some diseases to our ancestors when they interbred. Dr Simon Underdown, a principal lecturer in anthropology at Oxford Brookes University and co-author of the study, said: 'As Neanderthal populations became more isolated they developed very small gene pools and this would have impacted their ability to fight off disease. 'When Homo sapiens came out of Africa they brought diseases with them. 'We know that Neanderthals were actually much more advanced than they have been given credit for and we even interbred with them. 'Perhaps the only difference was that we were able to cope with these diseases but Neanderthals could not.' The findings add to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were not as different from modern humans as was originally thought. Recent discoveries have suggested that rather than being brutish cavemen, Neanderthals had sophisticated culture, were master tool makers and may even have had their own language. The new study suggests that Neanderthals also suffered from many of the same afflictions and complaints that modern humans experience. Indeed, there is some evidence from caves that early humans may have burned their bedding in a bid to rid themselves of infestations of lice or bed bugs. Dr Underdown and his colleague Dr Charlotte Houldcroft, a researcher in infectious diseases at Cambridge University and University College London, analysed recent genetic studies on Neanderthals and other early humans. They also examined recent genetic research on common human pathogens that have aimed to trace their origins and combined it with fossil and archaeological evidence. Infectious bacteria like those that cause tuberculosis, shown above, may have been common in Neanderthals . Most evidence from the fossil record suggest that Neanderthals tended to suffer traumatic injuries as a result of their hunter gatherer lifestyle, but there are also signs of inflammation and infection. Their study, which is published on the open source database bioRxiv, contradicts the common view that infectious diseases only really became a problem for humans in the Holocene about 11,000 years ago when humans began living in dense settlements and farming livestock. Instead, they say many of the diseases we see around us today were common during the pleistocene when Neanderthals dominated much of Europe and Asia between 250,000 and 45,000 years ago, when they disappeared. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies . They say pathogens like TB, typhoid and Crimean fever that were thought to be zoonoses caught from herd animals may have actually originated in humans and were only passed to animals during the rise of farming around 8,000 years ago. Genetic sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan - another early human ancestor - DNA has shown that modern humans have inherited a number of genes from these extinct species. These include genes that provide immunity to viral infections such as tick-borne encephalitis. Dr Underdown said this virus would probably have been common in the forested areas of northern Europe that Neanderthals inhabited and so immunity would have been an advantage. Other genes found in modern Papua New Guineans that are involved in the immune response against viruses like dengue and influenza may have come from Neanderthals. The fossilised remains of Neanderthals, like the skull above, are revealing more details about their lifestyles . Analysis of ancient DNA has also shown that Neanderthals carried genes that would have protected them against bacterial blood poisoning, or sepsis. Dr Underdown said: 'There are genetic signals in the Neanderthal genome that suggest quite clearly that they were exposed to these types of diseases but also developed some resistance to them. 'It had been thought that many of these diseases began infecting humans with the population increases that came with domestication of animals and permanent settlements. 'Be here we have got Neanderthals being infected by these diseases long before those developments.'\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.5602949261665344, 0.4397050142288208]}\n",

Bath Abbey (pictured) could have the world's first natural underfloor heating system sourced from spring water in Roman drains.\\xa0The idea has been in the pipeline for years, but now excavation work has begun to determine whether it’s possible to connect a modern heating system with an ancient hot spring . The Abbey, which lies at the heart of Britain's only World Heritage city, was granted planning permission for the unique £18million scheme two years ago. Engineers plan to excavate ancient crypts below the church to tap into a Roman drain where 850,000 litres of natural spring water empties every day into the ground. They hope to divert the warm water instead through a network of underground pipes to provide a world-first natural underfloor heating system for the abbey. Church leaders believe the plans would provide a unique source of green energy for the abbey and help the 10th century building reconnect with the city's Roman roots. Plans show how Bath Abbey will use water from the city's ancient springs, which heat water used in its Roan Baths. Waste water currently filters out to the River Avon but could be put to use under the new scheme . An artist's impression of plans for Bath Abbey shows how the ground will be excavated to create the heating system, new work space and song school . Today, excavation work is taking place on Kingston Parade outside the Visitor’s Information Centre to determine the feasibility of installing the system. Each day, a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the Roman Baths from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site. A large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby River Avon – passing through the Great Roman Drain. The idea is, that it this waste water was harnessed correctly and converted, it could produce 1.5 megawatts of continuous energy – enough to heat Bath Abbey and the world-famous Roman Baths and Pump Room complex. Engineers are currently digging 13 ft (4 metres) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could be suitable to house a thermal heat exchanger, which transfers heat from one medium to another. A spokesman for the project told MailOnline that the investigations are in their infancy, but it appears that water levels may be too low to use in the Great Roman Drain area, but that energy could be harnessed in the Georgian part of the drain. A small scale trial is also underway to test how the heat can warm up different types of stone floors in the buildings. The Church of England’s ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of Bath’s 45°C spring water to power a modern heating system for the building. The idea is that waste water from the baths escaping down the Great Roman Drain would enter a hidden thermal heat exchange and heat the Abbey (illustrated above) Engineers plan to tap the power of warm waste water from the Roman bathing complex (pictured).\\xa0Engineers are currently digging 13 ft (4 metres) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could be suitable to house a thermal heat exchanger . The plans for Bath Abbey's underfloor heating may use modern technologies, but will make use of the same natural spring tapped by the Romans. The Romans came up with underfloor heating called a hypocaust, which heated houses and public spaces with hot air. The word comes from the Ancient Greek, where hypo means under and caust means burnt. Romans used underfloor heating, or hypocausts to heat rooms at Bath's intricate bathing complex. Here, you can see the pilae stacks though which hot air would have circulated to heat a tile floor on top . The floor was raised above the ground by pillars called pilae stacks and made of a layers of tiles sandwiched together with concrete. The air under the floor was heated by a furnace. Walls were also made of hollow bricks so hot air could circulate through them, as well as below the tiles. Rooms requiring the most heat were placed closest to the furnace, the heat of which could be adjusted by adding more wood to the fire. It was labour intensive to sun a hypocaust as the fire needed a lot of fuel and constant attention, meaning underfloor heating was used in large public buildings, luxurious villas and bath complexes. Every day, a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the Roman Baths from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site. A large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby River Avon (pictured)– passing through the Great Roman Drain . The modern elements of the system would be hidden underground and an archaeologist will be working alongside the engineers to document any objects that may be uncovered by the excavation. Once the investigation is complete, the ground will be covered back up and the engineers will work out how the thermal heat exchanger will be housed. Charles Curnock, Footprint Project Director from Bath Abbey, said: ‘An innovative thermal heating scheme using Bath’s hot springs ticks all the right boxes, while providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for both the Abbey and the Roman Baths & Pump Room complex.’ Two years ago, Bath Abbey rector Edward Mason said: ‘These are ambitious plans which would allow us to capture an incredible and ancient natural resource which is currently being wasted. ‘The Abbey lies at the heart of what was once Roman Bath, and our architects have located a drain where spring water flows. ‘As it stands, the water pours away and empties eventually into the Avon. ‘Our plan is to remove the floor of the Abbey, dig down and divert the drain and then pump the water through an underground heating system to warm the church. ‘It would provide virtually all of the Abbey's heating and would give us a unique way to reduce our carbon footprint.'

However, his first set of adoptive parents abandoned him and the second set turned out to be abusive. Adding to Crapser's struggles, at no point did his guardians seek the green card or citizenship for him that they should have. Deportation fears: Korean adoptee Adam Crapser, left, poses with daughters, Christal, one, Christina, five, and his wife, Anh Nguyen, in the family's living room in Oregon . Now,  after a life battling joblessness because of his lack of immigration papers, homelessness and crime, Crapser is facing deportation. 'The state abandoned him when he was a child,' his attorney, Lori Walls, said. 'Now the US is throwing him out.' Federal immigration officials say they became aware of Crapser after he applied to renew his green card two years ago: his criminal convictions, ranging from burglary to assault, made him potentially deportable under immigration law. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement wasn't aware of Crapser's childhood adoption history when it decided to pursue his deportation, agency spokesman Andrew Munoz said. Two U.S. senators, including Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, are proposing a stand-alone, automatic citizenship bill for adoptees like Crapser. Growing pains: This undated photo provided by Crapser shows him around the age of three with his sister . Struggles:\\xa0Abandoned by one adoptive family, separated for nearly three decades from his only biological sister, and exposed to abuse by another American adoptive couple, Crapser struggled with rejection, homelessness and crime . 'It was not his responsibility to fill out that immigration paperwork,' Merkley said. 'He knows no other country.' Advocates say thousands of adoptees don't know they aren't citizens until they, for example, try to get a job. The federal government does not track the citizenship status of international adoptees or how many have faced deportation. The State Department says it is aware of adult adoptees who are in immigration removal proceedings. Adoptees who didn't become citizens are lawful permanent residents - but they lack the documents to prove it. Their stories about deportation to countries as diverse as India, Russia or Brazil are detailed on advocacy websites. Many of them remained stuck in legal limbo. A provision that would make citizenship automatic for all international adoptees regardless of age was added to a Senate immigration bill several years ago. But when reform stalled, the provision did, too. Since the 1950s, American couples have adopted nearly half a million children from other countries; about 100,000 of those children came from South Korea. For years, it was the parents' responsibility to seek citizenship, but many did not. In 2000, lawmakers made citizenship automatic for international adoptees, but the law wasn't retroactive. It excluded adoptees 18 or older at the time. Crapser wouldn't have met the criteria. Seven years after Crapser and his sister were adopted, their parents abandoned them. The foster care system separated Crapser, ten at the time, from his sister, whom he was dependent on, according to orphanage records. The boy bounced through several foster and group homes. When Crapser was 12, he moved in with Thomas and Dolly Crapser, their biological son, two other adoptees and several foster children. The next four years, Adam Crapser said, the couple choked, kicked and hit him and the other children every day, slammed them against walls, set dogs to attack them and burned them with hot objects. Still in limbo: Crapser  poses with daughter, Christal, one,  in the family's living room . 'Everything I did was wrong,' he said. 'As far as humiliation goes, I have been there.' His father also used racial epithets to address him and forced him to forget Korea. 'He always told me I'm American, and that I need to let go of my past,' Adam Crapser said. In 1991, the couple was arrested on charges of physical child abuse, sexual abuse and rape. They denied the charges. Thomas Crapser's sentence included 90 days in jail, and his wife's three years of probation. Because students at his high school teased him about the abuse, Adam Crapser said he dropped out of 9th grade. He became homeless and slept in a shelter or the back of an old car while working several fast food jobs and finishing his high school equivalency diploma at night. The Crapsers had not obtained U.S. citizenship papers for him. Over the next few years, Adam Crapser struggled alone, and also got into trouble with the law. Once it was after he broke into his parents' home - it was, he said, to retrieve the Korean Bible and rubber shoes that came with him from the orphanage - and later it was for stealing cars and assaulting a roommate. Because he lacked a green card to prove he could work in the U.S., he opened a barber shop and an upholstery business - something he could do without immigration papers. He said his parents withheld his adoption record for years, so it wasn't until 2012 that Adam Crapser submitted a green card application - which set in motion his path to a deportation hearing. Adam Crapser said he takes full responsibility for his crimes, but he has 'done his time' and changed his life. 'America promised me a home,' he wrote in his court declaration. 'I implore this country to keep its promise. If not for me then for my children, so they won't have to grow up without a dad.'\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.6566357612609863, 0.34336423873901367]}\n",

Following her heart: Giuliana claims Jerry cheated on her with Spice Girls singer Geri Halliwell, however she still took him back . Their romance turned serious when talks of marriage began, but that quickly changed when Jerry began chatting up Rebecca at\\xa0Maxim\\'s 100 Hottest Women party in 2004. \\'Little did I know he was in the VIP area, talking up Rebecca.

Sorry, homegirl...Things change, but you take care, OK?\\' While Giuliana\\'s love life is now going strong with husband Bill Rancic, the actress has now found herself putting out another fire. Just a month earlier Giuliana stirred up controversy when she commented on Fashion Police that Zendaya smelled of \\'patchouli oil\\' or \\'weed\\' when she arrived to the Oscars with dreadlocks. Saying her piece: The E! star aired her side of the Fashion Police controversy in an interview with Today . Heartfelt: The TV star confessed \\'I do not have an eating disorder\\' - nor has she ever - in her Today interview . On Monday, Giuliana - who looked fantastic with a bubble gum pink lace\\xa0top that was paired with a high-waisted white peplum skirt - talked to the Today Show about Zendaya. \\'I made a reference to the hippie culture. I talked about patchouli oil, which is a hippie perfume. And in the editing process, some of the gestures I made, some of the things I said were taken out for time,\\' the beauty said. \\'I made peace signs, I said \"bohemian\" twice - those were taken out for time.\\' Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . \\'So when the joke aired, some people were offended by it.

Love at last: The star has been married to The Apprentice winner Bill Rancic since 2007 - here the couple are pictured in October in Los Angeles . \\'I do not have an eating disorder. I have never had an eating disorder. I wanted to be very clear about that. In fact, I eat a lot. People always love to tweet: \"Eat a burger.\" I eat burgers. It\\'s not working,\\' she told Savannah Guthrie. Giuliana, who had a double mastectomy after revealing she had breast cancer, added: \\'But the main thing is I\\'ve lost a considerable amount of weight really in the past year or two due to the cancer medication that I\\'m on... I was eating more than I\\'ve ever eaten, but I was losing weight, and I was scared. I didn\\'t think, this is great. I though, what the heck\\'s happening to my body?\\' Giuliana - who announced last week she was moving to Chicago - has also suffered a personal blow in her efforts to add to her family. \\'Everyone\\'s been asking us about our last embryo because we would talk about it on our reality show.

It didn\\'t work out.\\' The star appeared optimistic when she added: \\'But that\\'s okay, there are other options. I\\'ve always been open to adoption, even before we had issues.

A jilted lover who sent explicit revenge porn images of his ex-partner to her daughter and set up 67 Facebook profiles to bombard her with abuse has been jailed. Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with abusive messages over the internet after she tried to end their relationship in October last year. A court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on to her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that\\xa0the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant,\\xa0saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she\\xa0'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. She said: 'He started setting up different profiles on Facebook to send me messages. He also sent my family messages and my friends messages because he couldn't get to me. 'I was very upset, it drove me insane, it made me depressed. I'm on medication. 'His language was absolutely disgusting. He was asking me why I wasn't playing any more, calling me names.' The victim said Cotterill found pictures of her on the internet that he threatened to send to her family and friends. He sent more than one to her daughter, she said. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes . In October last year, Cotterill sent the victim a link to an x-rated explicit video with a message that said: 'F**k it, I'm going to have it as my profile picture'. He also taunted the victim on Facebook, telling her: 'I am going to send some more pictures too because it's fun lol.' The 42-year-old was 'driven insane' and suffered depression and panic attacks after Cotterill spent a year sending 'disgusting' messages. David Houldcroft, defending, said Cotterill, who had two previous\\xa0convictions for harassment, accepted sending the link and that it would have caused her upset. Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim . 'He regrets that and understands that he has problems with relationships,' Mr Houldcroft said.

Mariah rejected Nick's numerous demands for a $30 million divorce settlement so now he's writing the book — saying he plans get his payday for being married to her one way or another - and there is nothing she can do about it because he already signed the deal last week with major publishing company Simon and Schuster. Simon & Schuster has confirmed to Daily Mail Online that the book is being published by Gallery Books, an imprint of the high-powered publisher. 'Mariah was willing to give Nick $10 million but he said 'hell no' and demanded $30,' a family friend tells the Daily Mail exclusively. 'Mariah says it is what they agreed to in the prenup before they got married. Scroll down for video . Battle of wills: Even though they have a prenup that would pay Nick $10million, Nick wanted more. When Mariah refused he decided to get his payday through a book deal. But Nick insisted he needs and deserves more than what they originally talked about, but Mariah wouldn't budge. Now Nick is being very vengeful, dating other women in public including Nicole Murphy, Michael Strahan's ex, the source says. 'Mariah kept telling Nick she was not going to give him a penny more than $10 million,' \\xa0says the friend. 'He told her he could write a book and get $30 million and much more for a movie deal for all of the crap she put him through over the years. 'Mariah told Nick nobody cares what he has to say and told him to take it or leave it because that's it - not a penny more.' The friend believes Nick asked for an outrageous amount from Mariah so when she said 'no' he could use that as an excuse to go to the book publisher. Nick hardly needs Mariah's money- although she is worth more than ten times his value. The actor and host of America's Got Talent has an estimated net worth of $20 million. Mariah is worth about $225 million. The estranged stars have been going back and forth about this since Nick filed for divorce in December. He was finally tired of arguing with her. ''He says she is being unreasonable so he has to do what he has to do. 'Now Mariah is angry, devastated and scared that Nick will reveal her inner most secrets and make her look like a desperate fool.' Mariah was crazy about Nick and trusted him with everything in her life but, now she feels he has turned out like every other man in her life and she is completely crushed, the friend reveals. Mariah, 45, and Nick, 34, have been battling about money and custody of their twins since he filed the divorce papers four months ago and even though there is a prenuptial agreement Nick is willing to air their dirty laundry — for a big fat check. US singer Marih Carey and her husband, US movie maker and actor Nick Cannon, leave the hotel to have a dinner at the Eiffel Tower in 2012 to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary . Battle for the babies: Who gets custody of twins Monoe and Moroccan Cannon is another issue in the divorce battle . Mariah and Nick were married on her private estate in the Bahamas on April 30, 2008 and they welcomed their twins Monroe and Moroccan on April 30, 2011. However, in August 2014, Nick confirmed that he and his wife, Mariah had been separated for a few months and he filed for divorce on December 12, 2014. 'Nick says he is going to tell the world about Mariah's drug use, her strange eating habits, psychosis, what she has said about other artists, her sexual proclivities and her parenting skills. It which will really be hurtful,' the insider continued. 'And Nick is also going to explain why he thinks he should have full custody of the twins. Mariah has admitted she never wanted children and Nick is going to tell the world why she felt that way.

            "{'sequence': \"They already have a fearsome reputation as the top predator of their time, but it seems the Tyrannosaurs were also prone to eating each other. A new study has uncovered evidence that a relative of Tyrannosaurus rex, called Daspletosaurus, may have indulged in cannibalism. Paleontologists have found bite marks on the fossilised skull of a juvenile Daspletosaurus, which lived around 75 million years ago. This artist's reconstruction shows a Daspletosaurus feeding on the body of another in an act of cannibalism . While some of the injuries appear to have been sustained during combat with other tyrannosaurs, others appear to have occurred after death. The scientists believe that another Daspletosaurus, which could grow to nine metres (30ft) as adults and weigh up to four tons, fed on the youngster's body. Tyrannosaurus rex and its relatives were more intelligent than previously thought and hunted in gangs which included young and older members, researchers have claimed. Scientists believe they have evidence that the top predatory dinosaurs were highly intelligent pack animals, despite T-rex being popularly depicted as a dangerous but dim-witted loner. This is a myth that has grown up because for many years their fossil skeletons tended to be found on their own, researchers say. The new theory follows an analysis of skeletons of the tyrannosaur Tarbosaurus bataar from 90 sites in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia. Tarbosaurus, a cousin of T-rex that lived around 70 million years ago, was a two-legged predator up to 12 metres long and weighing five tonnes. At least half a dozen of the animals appear to have belonged to a single social group, including adults and juveniles, that died together. The findings help to shed light on the brutal world in which the dinosaurs inhabited. Dr David Hone, a paleontologist at Queen Mary University of London, who led the research said: 'This animal clearly had a tough life, suffering numerous injuries across the head including some that must have been quite nasty. 'The most likely candidate to have done this is another member of the same species, suggesting some serious fights between these animals during their lives.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal PeerJ, were examining the skull of a Daspletosaurus found in a quarry in the Dinosaur Provincial Park close to Calgary, Alberta in Canada in 1994. Daspletosaurus, which means 'frightful lizard', is thought to be a close relative of the more famous Tyrannosaurus rex and roamed north America between 77 million and 74 million years ago. With a massive, heavy skull that could be more than 3ft (1 metre) in length, it would have had a powerful bite and probably preyed on large armoured ceratopsid dinosaurs. The dinosaur latest study was thought to be a juvenile, measuring just under 19.7 feet (6 metres) and weighed around half a tonne. The researchers found numerous injuries on the skull, several of which appeared to match the teeth of tyrannosaurs. The skull of the juvenile\\xa0Daspletosaurus (above) was covered in bite marks made by Tyrannosaur teeth . David Hone (left) and Darren Tanke (right) studied the fossilised skull at the Royal Tyrrell Museum . One bite to the back of the head broke off part of the skull and left a circular tooth-shaped puncture through the bone. However, there are signs the bone had begun healing, suggesting the injury was not fatal and that the animal lived for some time after it was inflicted. While the researchers cannot say what killed the Daspletosaurus, damage on the jaw bones suggest that a large tyrannosaur bit into the dead creature between one and three times in what appears to be feeding behaviour. Daspletosaurus is thought to have not just hunted but also scavenged for food and the research team say the injuries appear to have occurred after it had begun to decay. Cannibalism is relatively common in the natural world, with more than 1,000 species known to eat their own species. The fossilised skull of\\xa0Daspletosaurus was found in a quarry in Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada . Daspletosaurus, shown in the artists reconstruction above,  led a violent life the study suggests . Tyrannosaurus rex is also thought to have indulged in cannibalism, according to a study in 2010. Writing in the journal, Dr Hone and his colleague Darren Tanke from the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta, said the Daspletosaurus appeared to have lived a violent life involving battles with other members of its own species. They said: 'Numerous wounds were inflicted during life and despite some considerable damage the animal clearly survived as shown by the evidence of healing. 'These were likely inflicted at least in part by one or more conspecifics and perhaps as a result of numerous separate instances of conflict. 'After death, the animal suffered at least one major bite to the right dentary, and perhaps two more from another tyrannosaurid, possibly another Daspletosaurus. 'The specimen must have been decaying prior to the delivery of the bite to the dentary, and the condition of other material suggests scavenging, rather than simply late-stage carcass consumption.'\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.7175941467285156, 0.282405823469162]}\n",

Terry McCarty was just six years old when he was engulfed with flames after his brothers filled a bowl with kerosene which was set alight and accidentally knocked on to him. The 29-year-old, from Hawthorne, Nevada, endured 58 operations as well as cruel taunts from bullies who called him Freddy Krueger because of the scars on his face, body and arms. But he was determined to overcome the harrowing experience that had crippled his confidence for years. Form victim to hero: Terry McCarty was just six years old (left) when he suffered third-degree burns to 70 per cent of his body in a childhood accident. He has now overcome his terrible injuries and cruel taunts from bullies by becoming a firefighter (right) after refusing to let 'fear take over my life' Endured 58 operations: Terry McCarty aged six with his mother Nancy. He was engulfed with flames after his brothers filled a bowl with kerosene which was set alight and accidentally knocked on to him . He said: 'After the accident I lived in a constant state of fear and uncertainty. 'I struggled to find work as an adult as people always told me I was a liability, and I had started to believe it. 'Becoming a fireman was a spur of the moment decision - I thought if I could do this, people would realise I could do anything.' Mr McCarty applied to a Washington fire service in October 2011. After his application was accepted in April 2012, he faced 12 weeks of gruelling training, where he confronted fire for the first time since his accident. 'If I could do this, people would realise I could do anything': Terry McCarty in his bunker gear aged 26 (left) and 27 (right). He applied to the fire service in October 2011 and passing his training in July the following year . He said: 'As part of my training I had to complete a live fire exercise, where fire is made using propane in an artificial setting. 'Fear washed right over me, just as the fire had all those years ago. 'I couldn't move, I felt like I was six years old again when I saw those flames shooting out of the ceiling. 'But I think it helped. In the end - I started to realise the fire didn't control me. Why should I let fear take over my life?' In July 2012, having passed his training, Mr McCarty won the admiration and respect of his colleagues and the public. He said: 'Attending events, or even just being out in public in my uniform, always attracted a mixture of shocked and awed reactions.' Agony: Terry McCarty aged six (left) and (right) after undergoing skin grafts aged seven. He suffered cruel taunts from bullies who called him Freddy Krueger because of the scars on his face, body and arms . Always there for him: Terry McCarty at his homecoming aged 16 with his father and brother Ryan . Mr McCarty lost part of his fingers and thumbs in the accident and had to teach himself how to quickly put on his uniform and air tank and properly brace himself with his hip when using a hose. Having spent two years as a firefighter, he quit the force to work with the Burned Children Recovery Foundation at Camp Phoenix, a programme in Bellingham, Washington, supporting children with burns. He said: 'Fire robbed me of my childhood - I wanted to give these children a chance to experience being a kid, even for a short time.' After his accident in 1992, he was placed in a medically-induced coma for two months at Shriners Hospital in Galveston, Texas. Mr McCarty was hospitalised for 12 months and remembers this time vividly, including the debridement process of scrubbing off his burned skin, and multiple skin grafts. He said: 'It was absolutely terrifying. I didn't understand anything - all I knew was that when I saw a doctor, I should expect pain. 'I'd be taken out of surgery just long enough to stabilise and then I'd be rushed back in.' Brave: Mr McCarty lost part of his fingers and thumbs in the accident and had to teach himself how to quickly put on his uniform and air tank and properly brace himself with his hip when using a hose . Terry McCarty shows off his nickname 'Char King' which he got tattooed onto his arm . After a year of recovery, he returned to school at the age of eight, where he became the victim of bullies who would call him 'monster', 'toast' and 'Freddy Krueger'. He said: 'The one thing that got me through was the love of my family - especially my brothers, Ryan and Jason. 'There was never any anger between us, and I don't know what I would've done without them.' He and his brothers became inseparable and with their encouragement and support he found the courage to stop hiding himself, and accept the stares and comments. He said: 'The emotional bond we had was vital to my recovery - they did so much for my confidence by just being there.' Apart from the scarring and damage to his hands, he suffered no major health issues as a result of the burns, and quickly adjusted to moving with his tighter skin. He is now focusing on opening his own foundation to fund programmes for children with burns. Although he has no immediate plans to return to firefighting, he hopes his foundation, which will focus on fundraising, will provide the financial support needed for other foundations that offer firefighting experience. Mr McCarty, now of Bellingham, Washington, said: 'Nothing like this programme has been done before. 'It's going to take a lot of work, but being able to support people who suffered like I did will make it all worthwhile.'\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.797003984451294, 0.20299598574638367]}\n",

I cracked jokes with them to get out of the situation mentally. 'They saw me as a good person and I think that's why I wasn't physically harmed or raped or anything like that.' An investigation revealed that Elizondo was targeted by the kidnappers because her father was a well-known wealthy business man in the area, according to The Inquisitr. The men demanded a $160,000 ransom when they first called Elizondo's father. She was told by the kidnappers that her father lived a secret life and sold alcohol and cigarettes to the Mexican drug cartel. But eventually, one of the kidnappers introduced Elizondo to his mother, who helped her escape to another location where her parents could reach her. The kidnappers, named as Milton Treviño, Miguel Angel Cruz Navarro, 35, and Onan Herrera-Sanchez, 28, were all arrested. Investigators revealed the Elizondo was targeted because her father was a wealthy and well-known businessman in the area. The kidnappers demanded a $160,000 when they first reached out to the psychology graduate student's father . Investigators said that Treviño, Herrera-Sanchez and Navarro's wife Elva Navarro were responsible for taking Elizondo from the parking lot. Navarro, who was supposedly the ringleader of the operation, was sentenced to 34 years in prison in April 2014, according to FOX Rio. Treviño, who pleaded guilty in the case in 2013 was sentenced to ten years in prison and Herrera-Sanchez was sentenced to 20 years. Elva Navarro was sentenced to three years in December 2014 to three years for her role at a spa that injected women with a deadly fake botox, according to Valley Central. She is still facing kidnapping charges, among others.\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.5277999639511108, 0.4721999764442444]}\n",
            "{'sequence': \"An alleged fraudster has been accused of posing as Oprah Winfrey, executives from her TV network, former Obama aide Reggie Love and Madonna's manager in an attempt to trick people into giving him jobs, clothes, free food and jewelry worth $2.4million. Justin Jackson, a Florida man, has been carrying out the bizarre schemes in the hope of cashing in on the freebies, or winning himself a job in luxurious hotels, according to court documents. Jackson is being sued by Oprah's TV network as well as Love - the college basketball star who went on to be the President's personal assistant. 'Con man': Justin Jackson, right, has been accused of pretending to be a host of celebrity-linked characters in order to score freebies and jobs. Angel Agarrat, left, is also named in a Florida lawsuit attempting to get the pair to stop posing as other people . Legal papers filed in a south Florida federal court describe Jackson waging an eight-year trail of deceit in which he variously posed as Oprah herself, Oprah's nephew, Love, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), and managers of Madonna and Johnny Depp. The earliest fraud, the papers said, saw Jackson trick a New York City jeweler into lending him items worth $2.4million by pretending to be Madonna's manager. He contacted a store in July 2007 and said she needed the lavish items for a photoshoot, the papers said. When he got the items, he reportedly sold them to another jeweler and fled. The court papers say he was convicted for grand theft over the ruse, but later dreamed up new celebrity-linked schemes. The latest claims say Jackson pretended to be Oprah and her representatives in the hope of getting more freebies - and even posed as the famous talk show host to recommend him for jobs. He allegedly sent letters on forged OWN stationery to \\xa0five different hotel groups with locations in Florida, recommending himself for work at the locations. 'Impersonator': Jackson (right) is accused of sending messages purporting to be former Obama aide Reggie Love (left), whom he said worked for Oprah. The right-hand photograph, court papers claim, was emailed from an email account allegedly belonging to Johnny Depp's manager, asking for tickets to see Oprah . The papers claim some of the notes purportedly to be directly from Oprah, while others claimed to be from Love, who was signed off as the star's 'executive assistant and personal aide'. Also named in the claims was Angel Agarrat, whom lawyers claim was also involved in the deception, and was subject of some of the bogus letters of recommendation for jobs. In one of the exchanges, Jackson allegedly suggested that if he and Agarrat were to be given work at the hotels, Oprah would make a personal appearance there. One letter even claimed Jackson was Oprah's nephew. Love has never worked for Oprah. Other schemes allegedly saw Jackson write to four different jewelry companies, as well as a clothe retailer, to get free goods allegedly meant for Oprah. Scheme: According to the claims, Jackson signed some emails off as Oprah, left, and others as Scott Garner, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network . The claims date from around September 2013 to the end of 2014. The documents also say Jackson has a history of pretending to be Love, and had tried in 2010 to trade off Love's own name to get free designer clothes, handbags and Cheesecake Factory vouchers. In a final case, Jackson . OWN, Love and Scott Garner, an executive at Oprah's company whose name was used, filed a joint suit against Jackson and Agarrat this week. It accuses the two of invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names, infringing trademarks and conspiracy. The documents ask that a judge files an injunction to stop the two using any of the false names, and also stakes a claim for financial damages. Although no figures are specified, arguments in the court papers imply that the figure will be at least $75,000.\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.5344541668891907, 0.46554574370384216]}\n",
            "{'sequence': \"Philip Hammond pledged to protect the Falklands from ‘Argentinian bullying’ last night as the country began legal action against British companies exploring for oil off the islands. It follows a provocative speech by Argentinian president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, prompting the Foreign Office to summon her ambassador for a dressing down. Buenos Aires responded by accusing three British oil firms of working without permission. The Argentine government said it was taking legal action against three British and two US companies for ‘exploration activities for fossil fuels on the Argentine continental shelf without obtaining the corresponding authorisation’. The legal complaint listed Rockhopper Exploration, Premier Oil, Falkland Oil and Gas Limited and US firms Noble Energy and Edison International – accusing them of sending a semi-submersible rig to explore a basin 120 miles north of the islands ‘subjected to the illegitimate British occupation’. Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (centre) poses with veterans of the 1982 Falklands War, during the commemoration of the 33rd anniversary of the conflict last week . It also warned the rig’s owner, Greece-based firm Ocean Rig, that it could face ‘legal consequences’ over the drilling. The diplomatic row over the fate of the Falklands has worsened in recent weeks, after the UK Government pledged to invest £180million in the islands’ defences over the next ten years. President Fernandez de Kirchner last week promised: ‘We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It’s not just wishful thinking.’ Her remarks came on the 33rd anniversary of Argentina’s invasion of the Falklands, leading to a conflict that cost 250 British and 650 Argentinian lives. Last night Foreign Secretary Mr Hammond said: ‘Cristina Kirchner’s threats against those who do business with the Falkland Islands are as hollow as they are illegal. The islanders have a perfect right to develop their oil and gas industry – and they can rely on us to protect them from Argentinian bullying as they do so.’ Alicia Castro, Argentine ambassador to the UK, was summoned by the Foreign Office on Wednesday. Yesterday, in a tit-for-tat move, Argentine deputy foreign minister Eduardo Zuain summoned the UK ambassador to Buenos Aires, John Freeman, to complain about recent spying revelations by Edward Snowden. Daniel Filmus, minister for the Malvinas – as Argentina calls the Falklands – said his government would try to block further oil exploration. ‘We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes,’ he said, adding that this could involve ‘an Argentine judge issuing an arrest warrant against those who operate illegally in Argentine waters’. Although Falkland residents overwhelmingly voted to stay British in a recent referendum, Buenos Aires claims the islands and surrounding waters belong to Argentina. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, pictured today, last month announced plans to boost the UK's military defences of the Falkland Islands . Last week, the Argentine president and ambassador Alicia Castro publicly attacked the UK Government's plan to boost defences on the South Atlantic islands. Mrs Kirchner's government has also suggested that British oil firms could be prosecuted if they start drilling in the waters around the islands without formal permission from Argentina. The outspoken Argentine president's latest comments came on April 2, the 33rd anniversary of the start of the 1982 Falklands War. She reportedly said: 'International law and dialogue, not militarisation, are the path to a reunion and sovereignty. 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking.' But a Foreign Office spokesman attacked the provocative intervention. He said: 'The UK has no doubt about its sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and surrounding maritime areas, nor about the Falkland Islanders' right to decide their own future. 'We object strongly to recent statements by the Argentine president and the Argentine ambassador to London and so summoned the ambassador to account for these.' It came after the British government last week dismissed the threat of prosecution against oil and gas firms working off the Falkland Islands. Three British firms - Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas - announced that they had found oil and gas in a remote field north of the islands, which are claimed by Argentina. Last month, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the Government was preparing to 'beef up' defences in the Falklands. He said two Chinook helicopters and an upgraded surface-to-air missile system will be part of a new defence package for the islands. Mr Fallon said: 'We've been reviewing the defence of the Falklands, we do that every so often, and I'm going to be announcing to parliament later today how we are going to beef up the defences there, how we are going to modernise our defences, and to reassure the islanders that we are absolutely committed to their right to remain British and to the defence of the islands... 'We are absolutely committed to defending the Falklands. The threat to the Falklands has not gone away.' He said 'modernising what we are doing' in the Falklands was a response to the threat of Russia. 'Russia has changed. We hoped Russia would be a partner to us – a normal trading partner that respected the rules of the international system, but it's turned out that Russia is directly competing against and is becoming much more aggressive in lots of different parts of the world, and we have to respond to that.'\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.6139853000640869, 0.3860147297382355]}\n",
            "{'sequence': \"A dangerous 'death ring' has been spotted around the San Francisco Bay Area. Scientists say the lethal ring is leaving tens of thousands of creatures with severe, and often fatal injuries. Now researchers have released an interactive roadkill map to show the trail of destruction being caused by California's state highways. To view the interactive map, click here . Pictured are the South San Franscisco bay Area regional highway roadkill hotspots. The ring of death refers to an area made up of made up of I-80 (labelled as 9) and Route 101 (labelled as 13 and 8) The map uses data from the California Roadkill Observation System, a volunteer-submitted database of instances where wildlife and vehicles collided over the past five years. It assigns different coloured markers for various sizes of species. Clicking on the dots reveals the species - striped skunk, mountain lion, black bear, gopher snake, desert iguana - and where and when they were hit. Animals can also be mapped individually. Major hotspots include the Sacramento area where I-80 and I-5 run across bypasses along the Pacific Flyway. In the region, marshy areas attract birds during migration resulting in high rates of roadkill. Where I-80 and I-5 run across bypasses along the Pacific Flyway, marshy areas attract birds during migration and result in high rates of roadkill . Sacramento area: Where I-80 and I-5 run across bypasses along the Pacific Flyway, marshy areas attract birds during migration and result in high rates of roadkill. Bay Area: 'It's sort of a ring of death around the Bay Area,' Shilling said. Interstate 80 and State Route 101 run alongside the bay, where high rates of wading birds and water birds are killed. Large animals are more likely to be hit on I-280 and State Route 17, particularly near areas of parks and open spaces. Southern California: Many areas along State Route 94 in San Diego County have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat. Shilling said Caltrans is planning to build five new wildlife-crossing structures in this area because the data demonstrate both an immediate need and locations where structures would be useful. Sierra: Highway 70 in Plumas County and near Portola has high rates of roadkill, particularly deer. North Coast: Both State Routes 101 and 20 show high rates of collision between Willits and Lake Mendocino. 'It's sort of a ring of death around the Bay Area,' said Fraser Shilling at the\\xa0University of California, Davis, who led the study. Interstate 80 and State Route 101 run alongside the bay, where high rates of wading birds and water birds are killed. Large animals are more likely to be hit on I-280 and State Route 17, particularly near areas of parks and open spaces. Meanwhile, many areas along State Route 94 in San Diego County have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat. Highway 70 in Plumas County and near Portola also has high rates of roadkill, particularly deer. And on the North Coast, both State Routes 101 and 20 show high rates of collision between Willits and Lake Mendocino. Fraser Shilling, co-director of the Road Ecology Center at University of California, Davis, says it is the largest wildlife monitoring system in the state. It features more than 29,000 sightings of more than 390 of California's 680 native vertebrate species. The report's findings cover about 40 per cent of the total state highway system. Meanwhile, the public are being encouraged to submit entries, including photographs, to add to the map. 'These data help identify places where immediate action is warranted,' says Shilling, who is also a research scientist with the UC Davis department of environmental science and policy. According to Caltrans and California Highway Patrol statistics, there are about 1,000 reported accidents each year on state highways involving deer, livestock, and other wildlife. There is one long hotspot in the circled area, representing 20 miles of SR190. The 419 roadkill observations of 36 species within the hotspot were collected \\xa0between April 2011 and October, 2014 . Many areas along State Route 94 in San Diego County have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat . The drought may be increasing the number of roadkill, as animals seem to be putting themselves at greater risk to find food and water sources, crossing roads they may not have in the past. While deer tend to use landscape 'corridors' when migrating, most other species do not appear to be using them. Landscape corridors, also known as wildlife corridors, are strips of land intended to connect parks and other wildlife reserves. But the roadkill data suggest that most animals tend to cross where they can, regardless of the location of these corridors. Birds are among the most common wildlife group types killed by road collisions. For instance, there is a high rate of barn owl roadkill where I-5 runs through agricultural lands of the Central Valley. Without trees or other elevated structures by the highways, the owls swoop down for prey without considering the trucks and other vehicles coming toward them. In what has not always been a popular suggestion, Shilling recommends for these areas planting vegetation such as oleander and ice plant, non-native species that repel rather than attract wildlife to the roadsides. 'You have a sterile, dangerous place - the roadway,' Shilling says. 'You don't want to attract animals there.' The drought may be increasing the number of roadkill, as animals seem to be putting themselves at greater risk to find food and water sources, crossing roads they may not have in the past . The long continuous hotspot represents 681 roadkill observations of 57 animal species. This isout of a total for the highway of 899 observations of 66 total species collected by 7 roadkillobservers, between October 2010 and October 2014 .\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.5661570429801941, 0.4338429570198059]}\n",

Nicola Sturgeon today faced claims she would 'paralyse' the UK economy with her demand for another referendum on Scottish independence . The SNP leader has spent the day campaigning in a nursery in Loanhead, where she set out her 'triple lock' for a second referendum . The First Minister took a shot on the pool table as she played a game against children at the after-school club and community nursery . Ms Sturgeon was booed after saying on a TV debate this week that Scots should be given another say on breaking away from the rest of the UK. In September's referendum, 55 per cent voted in favour of staying in the UK, but the SNP has seen a surge in support since then and is set to take dozens of seats from Labour in the general election on May 7. Speaking during an election campaign visit to a nursery in Loanhead near Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon set out details of what she called a 'triple lock' that exists on independence. She said: 'Firstly, there would have to be a change of circumstances from the referendum last year for a proposal for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future. 'Secondly, people would then have to vote for that manifesto ... thirdly, people would then have to vote for independence. The point I am making is that this is a decision that lies in the hands of the people.' But the prospect of another referendum has been condemned by rival parties. Ms Sturgeon was booed after saying on a TV debate this week that Scots should be given another say on breaking away from the rest of the UK . Ms Sturgeon said next month's General Election is not a 're-run' of the referendum, but is buoyed by a surge in support for the SNP which suggests she could hold the balance of power after May 7 . Ms Sturgeon later escorted children to a bus, as she continued to set the political pace north of the border . Mr Clegg today warned of the impact on Scotland and the whole of the UK. Campaigning in Cornwall, he said: 'It is of huge significance that despite their protestations that they have got no plans to keep constantly asking everybody the same question until they get an answer they want, actually that is precisely what they intend to do. 'I think that would have a paralysing effect on the Scottish economy and would have a paralysing effect on the UK economy as a whole if we're constantly trying to guess every few years whether the SNP are going to get their way. 'They just don't seem to be able to accept the answer they received at the ballot box. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg warned the entire country would suffer if the SNP chose to 'constantly ask everybody the same question until they get an answer they want' 'There is almost a sort of Maoist tendency which says that the people must be wrong according to the SNP and that they must be forced to ask themselves the question over and over and over again until they give the answer which is satisfactory to Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon.' Mr Clegg went on: 'It is a bit like that Japanese soldier who emerged from the jungle after 30 years and he thought the Second World War was still on. I sometimes think the SNP's a bit like that.' In an STV debate on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon said next month's General Election is not a 're-run' of the referendum, . But she pointedly said 'that's another matter' when asked about her Holyrood manifesto for 2016. Her weak response was met with audible groans from the audience.

            "{'sequence': \"This is the moment a family got a shock after an elderly buffalo escaped being dinner for lions - only to run headlong into their car. Moya Gerber was travelling in her vehicle through the Kruger National Park, South Africa, when she spotted a male and female lion trying to bring down a Cape Buffalo. Moya's sister Rone Odendaal, 24, who is a teacher at\\xa0Laerskool Lothair, located in the village of Lothair, began taking pictures of the struggle, before noticing the buffalo was heading for the road. Battle:\\xa0Moya Gerber and her sister Rone Odendaal, 24, spotted this struggle between two lions and a buffalo in the Kruger National Park in South Africa, so they stopped to photograph it . Collision: After a few moments the buffalo managed to escape the lions' clutches, but headed straight for the road instead before running into the side of Ms Odendaal's car . While the beast managed to escape being eaten by the lions, it did receive a nasty knock to the head after running into the side of their van. Speaking to MailOnline, Ms Odendaal, who uploaded the pictures to her Instagram, said: 'We were on holiday. We go to the park a couple of times every year but this is the first time something like this has happened. 'It was on the third day of a five day trip in the morning that we saw the buffalo.\\xa0We were on the h3 road, going from the from Malelane satellite camp  towards Skukuza camp. 'It started when we saw two male lions just past abridge heading towards a waterhole. 'They got a drink of water and then slept under bushes on our left hand side and then we spotted the buffalo on our right side. 'The wind was in the lions favour, they jumped up in unison and walked fast over the road towards the buffalo.They looked really hungry and needed food, that's when the action started. 'The lions stalked the buffalo before one jumped on its back. That lion held on for almost 30 minutes until the buffalo ran towards the cars. It's horn punctured a car wheel which gave the lion a fright. 'The other male lion got thrown through the air but came back and also started biting the buffalo by its tail. We could smell the blood. Life or death: Miss\\xa0Odendaal, a teacher from the village of\\xa0Lothair, captured these images of the beasts fighting with one-another before the buffalo crashed into her vehicle . Explain that to the insurers! A fully grown buffalo can weigh up to 1,750lbs - about half the weight of a VW Golf - and stands six foot tall, meaning it left quite a dent in the car's door . 'Just before the lions could bring the buffalo down it punctured the car wheel and then ran into our car taking the mirror off. 'I was in the car with my sister and her two children, one-year-old Hendri, and Lisa who is four. 'The children started crying after the buffalo hit the car but we told them to sit really still. 'I hoped that the lions would manage to bring the buffalo down in order to feed. They need to eat as well but other people were screaming for the poor buffalo. 'I\\xa0gained even more respect for lions watching this with my own eyes the perseverance it takes to try and bring it down and the buffalo really hurt them running through the bush with them.' She also revealed that the unlucky buffalo caused around £11,000 worth of damage to the car. Nadav Ossendryver, the founder of\\xa0Latest Sightings, a website that tracks animals in the Kruger park, uploaded the pictures last week and said it was something he'd never seen before. Ms Odendaal's friends also joked about the close-shave on Facebook, with Jeremy Hallett quipping: 'Explain that to your insurance!' The Kruger National Park spans 7,500 square miles of territory in the north east of South Africa along its border with Mozambique, making it one of the largest game reserves in Africa. One of a kind: When Miss Odendaal's images were uploaded to website for spotting wildlife in the Kruger park, it's founder said he had never seen anything like it before . The park is home to more 12,000 elephants, 1,000 leopards, 2,800 lions, and 27,000 African Buffalo, with the climate ranging from savanna scrubland in the south, to tropical in the north. The buffalo that call the park home can reach heights of six foot and weigh around 1,750lbs - or around half the weight of a VW Golf. The male African lion, pictured here, reaches an adult weight of just under 500lbs, making it the second largest big cat after the tiger, but still nowhere near as large as the buffalo.\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.7288531064987183, 0.27114689350128174]}\n",
            "{'sequence': \"Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. The Crown Prosecution Service has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that Janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer’s disease. But now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an April 9 note to Lords authorities. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Lord Janner, who will not face child sex charges because he has dementia, with his daughter, rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner . Signed: The letter Lord Janner signed on April 9. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons . The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than £100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013. Last October he took a formal leave of absence from Parliament, allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months’ notice. New rules which came into effect last May provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks. But Janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior Lords official 12 days ago. A House of Lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself, but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his. Simon Danczuk, the Labour politician who exposed the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith’s horrific abuse of boys, said it was not right for Janner to stay in the Lords yet avoid court. ‘If you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator, then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law,’ he said. ‘If he has got a leave of absence from the Lords, that implies that he may get well. Why isn’t he retiring? It makes a mockery of it all. He is bringing the House of Lords into disrepute almost single-handedly.’ The Crown Prosecution Service faced widespread criticism after announcing that Janner (pictured) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer’s disease . Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: ‘He couldn’t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis. ‘But if he isn’t compos mentis, there’s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature. How can they say he’s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting Nazi war criminals? ‘It stinks of the Establishment covering up and ensuring he doesn’t have to take the stand in public. This is a cover-up, there can be no question about it.’ Janner’s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was suspended by Labour after the CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. Allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children’s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. After Beck was jailed, many other politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby. Mr Ashby, 74, who stood down from Parliament in 1997 after being caught up in the Major government’s sleaze scandals, appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday. ‘Of course I didn’t know anything at the time,’ he said from his home in South-West London. ‘The man has dementia and should be left alone.’ Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Lord Janner's QC son . Prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the Janner case. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Labour peer’s QC son. Neil Moore, who was based at the 23 Essex Street chambers where Daniel Janner works, was consulted by Mrs Saunders before she concluded not to prosecute. Senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about Mr Moore’s involvement in the decision-making process. But a spokesman for the UK’s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that Mr Moore informed her of the connection before any discussions took place. She said Mr Moore was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to Mr Janner for two years. The potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for Mrs Saunders as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision. Last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge Janner. Eleanor Laws QC recommended a ‘trial of the facts’ in the defendant’s absence to ‘get to the bottom of the allegations’. A CPS spokesman said: ‘It is the DPP’s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what the DPP has done.’\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.7411855459213257, 0.2588145136833191]}\n",

Pamela Clothier was admitted to hospital forcing her to leave her bungalow in Battle, Sussex. But the 92-year-old's family was under the impression she planned to sell the house and allowed charity Age UK to clear it out. Her beloved dog Mitzy was also taken to a local animal sanctuary and later re-homed. After returning to find the house empty, the great-grandmother has criticised the charity and her family. Scroll down for video . Pamela Clothier had to retrieve her possessions after she returned from hospital to find her house cleared . The 92-year-old says the worst thing was losing her dog, Mitzy, who was given to a local animal sanctuary . Mrs Clothier said: 'My son Peter didn't think I was going to make it, so he just upped and tried to sell everything. I can't believe he could be so cruel.' She added: 'They left me with nothing. All my furniture was gone, all my diaries, books, clothes, everything. The worst thing is that I can't get my dog back either.' She spoke about the incident after Age UK offered her an 'insulting' £1,000 compensation. She said: 'They did get me some of my furniture back, and I have been able to get more things from my friends, but I still feel like it's not my home any more. 'In my day I would have knocked the spots off anybody, but now I'm absolutely demolished.' Mrs Clothier has lived alone since her Bomber Command hero husband Clyde passed away in 1991. The fiercely independent nonagenarian added: 'I loved my home - it had masses of memories. I've got nothing now, not even my dog. 'Peter made up his mind that selling my property was the thing to do, and he got rid of the furniture that was clogging up the place. I was left effectively having to start my life over again.' Pamela Clothier says she was horrified when a charity cleared out her belongings without her permission . She said she did not explicitly permit the organisation to remove her belongings and wanted them back. The pensioner is calling for a change in the law to make it more difficult for charities to act in such a way without the homeowner's permission. 'I'm 92-years-old and I'm in a house which is almost empty,' said Mrs Clothier told the BBC's South East Today. 'All the work I've done,\\xa0all the knitting and sewing I've done,all the things I've made are gone. It's just like I didn't exist,' she added through tears. Mrs Clothier's son Peter  insists she knew what was happening and he saved many of her things . She said she was horrified the charity had carried out her son's instruction without checking with her first. 'I think they should be absolutely certain that the person who's holding the key\\xa0has the right to be doing what they're doing.' Her son, Peter Clothier, said his mother knew to expect her things would be cleared as they had made arrangements for her to move out of the home. 'Everything was done in negotiation with her, while she was in hospital I would visit with an iPad to show her the rooms and we negotiated what was going to be done, what would be kept and thrown out,' Mr Clothier told MailOnline. 'She was going to move into a home temporarily and then she was going to move into a flat. 'While she was in hospital I redecorated the house and she put it on the market but when she returned she decided she would rather stay. I did in fact save a lot of her things.' While Mrs Clothier was in care two years ago a driver from Age UK visited the property to collect her things. The charity has apologised for her ordeal and said it had reviewed its procedures since. 'We were advised that Mrs Clothier wanted to make a donation of furniture, small items and clothing, as she was moving into a nursing home and her property was to be sold,' a spokesman told MailOnline. When they learned she wanted her possessions back, Age UK say they invited her to collect them. 'Mrs Clothier attended our premises and took back the items she wanted. We feel we acted fairly in this situation and received donations in good faith at the request of her family member. 'We have never had an incident like this before or since. However, since this incident we have reviewed our procedures to minimise this happening again.' The 92-year-old said her home in Battle, East Sussex now feels empty with so few of her possessions left . Charities are legally able to remove the contents of an elderly person's home without checking with them if they have been expressly told to do so by a relative. But critics say more should be done to protect the elderly and their assets. 'We share Ms Clothier's outrage that her lifelong possessions have been stripped from her home without her permission,' said John Beer, chairman of Action on Elder Abuse.

Conceptual prison: In order to make initial contact with the prisoners, Kreth sent a postcard that had an image of her in a striped dress along with a note saying she thinks everyone lives in a type of prison . \\'They do it for the thrill,\\' she said, adding that she does not condone any of the perpetrators crimes. Kreth has written to men and women behind bars who she believes fit the bill of a sociopath and who have a certain level of intelligence so that they are able to discuss their crimes in a conceptual manner. The New York Post reports that the list of the killers Kreth interacted with include Michael Swango, a doctor who poisoned as many as 60 patients in a variety of different hospitals for over two decades. \\'I love it: the sweet, close, husky smell of indoor homicide,\\' Swango wrote in a notebook presented by prosecutors in 2000.

In 1979 police found his ex-girlfriends body beaten and mummified in his closet in 1979. She even reached out to prisoner Thomas \\'Bart\\' Whitaker, a man on death row for the murder of his devout Christian family in 2003. In order to make initial contact with the prisoners, Kreth sent a postcard that had an image of her in a striped dress. She planned to open conversation by saying that prison goes beyond padlocked walls. \\'I wanted to discuss how conceptually everyone lives in their own type of prison.\\' Kreth says she shared personal information about her own life so that the prisoners saw her as someone they would feel comfortable sharing their secrets with. \\'Sociopaths spend their whole life acting,\\' Kreth told Dailymail.com . \\'They can tell when people are being fake or genuine.

EXPLORE ALL THINGS INSIDE and OUTSIDE . . . I hope you’re not shy.\\' Kreth said she made it clear to prisoners that her interactions to them were not romantic, though it was her picture that got their attention. She says she would send Swango articles in publications in the New Yorker about sociopaths and that he would then circle parts of the story he felt were true characteristics of a killer. ‘A sociopath wants to feel like he is the smartest person in the world,’ Swango told her. When asked if he had guilt or remorse, Swango wrote, ‘The short answer to your question is, ‘nothing at all That’s why it went on for so long.

When asked if sociopath’s feel he wrote, ‘I would disagree that a sociopath can “neither feel empathy or true love.” One can be “empathetic” to some people or things and not to others. Where is the line between love, obsessive love, or something that looks like any of the above, but is not…? You & I could have a long discussion on the exact meaning of this phrase! Many gradations, many shades of gray between pure while & pure darkness/evil!’ Swango, Kreth told the Post, would sign his letters very bizarrely. ‘Sometimes he would sign his notes \"You know you love me, XOXO, Gossip Girl,\"” Kreth said. ‘He’s a 60 year old guy, who has maybe murdered 60 people, who’s into poison, and writing, ‘hey girl’ . . . and ‘OMG we must talk about ebola.’ ‘It’s darkly funny,’ she said.

An alleged killer Kreth has been dying to interview is millionaire Robert Durst who has been linked to three murders but never convicted. Durst, who was heir to a vast real estate empire before becoming estranged from his family, was arrested last month for the suspected 2000 murder of his friend, writer Susan Berman, in Los Angeles. ‘Durst once stole a sandwich for $6 but had $37,000 with him in his car.

In an interview with NBC 4\\xa0on Monday,  Pusok revealed that he had been handcuffed for \\'99 per cent\\' of the beating and that near the end of the scarring experience a deputy whispered into his ear \\'This isn\\'t over\\'. Scroll down for video . Scarring experience: Francis Pusok (left) spoke for the first time on Monday, four days after he was beaten up by cops in footage taken from a helicopter. His girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, pictured center . When San Bernardino County Sheriff\\'s deputies arrived at Pusok\\'s house on Thursday, he said he  fled \\'because any contact with police has been negative for me\\'. As the chase was coming to a close about two and a half hours later, video shows Pusok falling to the ground as he is hit with a taser and two deputies approach. The officers then start to assault Pusok, and later claimed that his taser had been ineffective due to his loose clothing - even though Pusok is clearly seen convulsing from the electric shock in the helicopter footage. On the run: Pusok fled his house in San Bernardino County on Thursday after Sheriff\\'s deputies showed up to arrest him on identity theft charges. He led police on a more than two-hour long chase, part of it on horseback . On the ground: At the end of the chase, police officers shot Pusok with a taser and he fell to the ground. Pusok claims they handcuffed him within 15 seconds and then continued to beat him despite the fact he was lying helpless on the ground . Cruel: The helicopter continued to record the first two cops beating Pusok up as more deputies swooped in . Under investigation: In the aftermath of the disturbing video, 10 officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated . Pusok estimates that within 15 seconds of the first taser hit, the cops had him in handcuffs but says they continued to assault him and yelled \\'stop resisting\\' even though he was laying face down on the ground. He says the officers went on to tase him two more times after he was in handcuffs. Pusok remembers the cops \\'hitting me every place that they could hit me - anywhere and everywhere.\\' \\'I thought I was being beaten to death,\\' said Pusok.. \\'I was wondering, \"When is it going to stop?\"\\' Bruised: Pusok sports a painful black eye in his booking photo. He was released from jail on Sunday . After the incident, Pusok was arrested on suspicion of evading, stolen property, reckless driving and theft of a horse. He was treated for his injuries while being held at West Valley Detention Center where he was released Sunday night at bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for June 16, but San Bernardino County Prosecutors said Monday that they had not yet made a decision on whether to file formal charges against Pusok. Meanwhile, 10 officers - including a sergeant and a detective - involved in the incident have been placed on paid leave as the FBI starts an investigation into whether excessive force was used in the arrest. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said last week that he was \\'disturbed and troubled\\' by the video and that an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies\\' actions. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. In his interview on Monday, Pusok said he thinks his prior run-ins with police may have sparked their violent backlash. Indeed, Pusok\\'s lengthy criminal record includes charges of obstructing an officer and resisting an officer, as well as attempted robbery, animal cruelty and fighting or offensive words. Deputies have been\\xa0called\\xa0to Pusok\\'s home before, during which he threatened to kill a deputy and shot a\\xa0puppy in front of his family, Sheriff McMhaon said. Disturbing: San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon says he was \\'disturbed and troubled\\' by the video and that he has launched an internal investigation . However, Pusok\\'s pregnant girlfriend, Jolene Bindner, says some of the prior charges against her longtime partner have been trumped up. Bindner told NBC that the charges he threatened to kill a police officer are \\'absolutely not true. I was there the whole time.\\' She also said that Pusok, father of their three children, was arrested in 2002 for driving at unsafe speed on a sidewalk but that he was only riding a bicycle at the time. What concerns Bindner the most though was the one deputy\\'s alleged whispered threat of \\'This isn\\'t over\\' at the end of the beating. \\'That concerns me because we have children together and I don\\'t want any kind of retaliation against me or my children,\\' she said. Doing better: After visiting her longtime partner in jail on Sunday, Pusok\\'s girlfriend Jolene Bindner said he was on the road to recovery . Threats: The couple share three children together and have another on the way. Bindner (left) says she is concerned about a deputy who whispered \\'This is not over\\' to her boyfriend at the end of the beating . Pusok\\'s attorney Jim Terrell said his client\\'s criminal history has nothing to do with any possible excessive force case. \\'If it wasn\\'t for that helicopter and the camera...they would be charging him with 10 counts of battering a police officer,\\' Terrell said. \\'That\\'s how it rolls here, that\\'s what goes on every single day.\\' Pusok\\'s beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder.

Former Royal chef Darren McGrady (right) said that when the Royal princes were children (left) they swapped the instructions from their nanny for their own in which they asked for fast food . William and Harry (pictured as children at Balmoral Castle with the rest of the Royals) were apparently fed up with the endless diet of traditional English food so wanted a change . William and Harry, pictured with their mother, dressed for the start of a new term at school in April 1990 . Mr McGrady said that their 'juvenile handwriting gave their identity away' - and that they ended up with roast chicken anyway. He said that he was 'more scared of the nanny than I was of William' so obeyed her rather than the third in line to the throne. In an interview with People magazine, he said: 'They may be royal children, but they still have children's palettes'. Mr McGrady is the former chef to The Queen and Princess Diana and spent a total of 15 years cooking for them at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace. During that time he got to know the family and their culinary tastes very well. 'I remember holding the boys as babies, when the Princess was eating cereal in the kitchen, thinking, 'Wow, here I am, literally holding the crown jewels,' McGrady he told\\xa0People. Mr McGrady said the young princes' (pictured with Princess Diana and Prince Charles) 'juvenile handwriting gave their identity away' - and that they ended up with roast chicken anyway .

He said that when the Princes were growing up the chef of the day at the Palace would send a list of suggestions to the nursery for what they should eat. The nanny made her choice and then a butler would bring the meals down to the children. William and Harry would eat the same food as adults only it would often be diced or pureed. Mr McGrady said that they were served 'traditional, English food' and William was supposedly fond of cottage pie and peas, poached chicken and rice and fish cakes. He said: 'Everything a normal British child would have. The only difference is that they had a chef cooking it for them.' When it came to dessert they went for 'quintessentially British comfort food' and their favourite was jam roly-poly. He said: 'Each time, I'd send up six pieces, and each of them would go.' Other desserts which were popular with the Princes included summer pudding and sticky toffee pudding which also happens to be a favourite of Princess Kate. Rank played its part even in what the children ate and whenever the Princes were joined by their cousins such as Zara and Peter Phillips or Prince Andrew's daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, their nanny decided what everyone ate as they were more senior.

The youngest of Jim Bob and Michelle\\'s children, Josie, seen here in Jim Bob\\'s lap, is younger than their eldest granddaughter Mackynzie, who is seated in the front row . Soon after the announcement was made, Anna Duggar shared an image of Jessa showing off her bump in a Twitter photo. Also in the snap is Jill, who was still with child at the time the photograph was taken. \\'Congrats @JessaSeewald @BenSeewald on your pregnancy! It was great to be pregnant together @jillmdillard,\\' she wrote in the caption. Anna, who is married to eldest Duggar Josh, is pregnant with the couple\\'s fourth child, a baby girl due in July. The couple, who married in 2008 after a chaste courtship, already have Mackynzie, Michael and Marcus. Josh works for the Family Research Council, a pro life, anti gay marriage Christian lobbying organization in Washington DC. The whole family is famously prolife and shuns birth control. Michelle stopped taking birth control after she miscarried early in her marriage. She had gone on the pill following eldest child Josh\\'s birth. Then she miscarried while taking birth control, she has said. Michelle then went off birth control and soon welcomed fraternal twins - and never used birth control again. Now Michelle and all her children proclaim that God does their family planning and they share their prolife beliefs on social media and the show. And lots of kids isn\\'t all he shares with his parents. He and Anna also seems to be continuing a tradition with naming, as all 19 Duggar children have names that start with J, and his three children all have M names. Josh shared this photo of his pregnant wife and three children at the airport a few days ago. His eldest child is older than his youngest sister . The whole family is outspokenly pro-life, and josh and Anna are seen here kneeling when attending a rally earlier this year. Josh now works for the Family Research Council, a conservative prolife group . Josh shared this photo of his wife and younger brother Joseph for Joseph\\'s birthday - wearing anti Roe v Wade t-shirts for the occasion . Jill, the fourth eldest Duggar, welcomed son Israel David earlier this month, ten months after her wedding. And now the fertility streak is continuing with daughter Jessa and her husband Ben. \\'We are looking forward to being parents,\\' Ben told People on Tuesday. \\'I am feeling pretty good,\\' added Jessa. \\'The morning sickness was different every day. It\\'s getting better, but I\\'m still hanging on to the heartburn. And I don\\'t have any super serious food cravings.\\' The announcement does not come as too much of a surprise to fans as in late March an image of the two was uploaded to Facebook that suggested they could be expecting. Ben was holding his wife\\'s stomach in a pose typically struck by couples who are about to share the good news that they\\'re planning for a little one. The picture, in which the newlyweds are smiling and making the shape of a heart with their hands on Jessa\\'s stomach, sparked rumors online of an impending pregnancy.

Ben works for Jim Bob Duggar doing odd jobs, and Jessa was always chief organizer for her younger siblings, organizing their home school and packing for trips. No doubt reality tv paychecks and assorted book and speaking fees will help the young couple afford the new addition. And both will have time to raise the little one. The Seewalds live in a house on the Duggar property, owned by Jim Bob and Michelle. Previously Josh and Anna lived their, and welcomed their two older children into the world in home births in the house. Mackynzie was born int he master bedroom, and Michael was born while Anna was on the toilet. Marcus was born at a midwifery center. It\\'s not known if Jessa plans to homebirth in the same house as Anna or not. Jessa\\'s older sister Jill Dillard, 23, and her husband, Derick, 26, welcomed son Israel David on April 6 after a 70-hour labor and an emergency c-section. They had planned a homebirth as well, as Jill is a midwife, but it didn\\'t go as planned. Jill says the doctor stitched her up really well, however, and she hopes to have many more pregnancies and deliver future children vaginally.

            "{'sequence': \"The New Zealand family of fourteen who last month walked out of a remote Christian commune that shuns the outside world are adjusting well to life in the wider community, a relative said, with the father accepting a farm job and the family moving into a home with modern appliances. James and Hope Ben Canaan last month declared they were living in a 'false system' and left the Gloriavale Christian Community, located at Lake Haupiri on New Zealand's West Coast, with their twelve children and few worldly possessions. Founded by the Australian-born evangelical preacher Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - Gloriavale is home to around 500 residents, sometimes known as Cooperites, who wear a plain, blue uniform and reject birth control. Scroll down for video . Free: The Ben Canaan family (picture supplied) have left behind Gloriavale for the outside world. Many family are pictured here in traditional Gloriavale uniforms, although they are now allowed to wear 'modest' clothing . Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament and reject the outside world . The Ben Canaans fled some 300km south to the town of Timaru, where supporters from the Marchwiel Reformed Baptist Church community have helped them adapt to a world where Christmas and birthdays are celebrated and money is used to purchase goods and services. '(They're doing) really, really good,' said Mr Ben Canaan's aunt, Miracle, who herself fled the picturesque commune with her husband and ten children around six years ago. 'They are adapting very well. They've got a job and everything. They've had a lot of support.' The family left Gloriavale, which is located at Lake Haupiri on the west coast of the South Island, for Timaru, around 320km away . Gloriavale residents do not hold celebrations for birthday parties or Christmas . Miracle, the daughter of Neville Cooper (pictured speaking in a previous interview with New Zealand television) said the Ben Canaan family are adapting very well . The Ben Canaans' close supporters have closed ranks around the family, who last month thanked the community for their support and requested privacy in order to 'settle into our new lives' in Timaru. Sources familiar with Gloriavale, such as Miracle - one of Neville Cooper's ten children - discussed the challenges of adjusting to life outside the commune in general terms to Daily Mail Australia. 'There's just a complete struggle in the outside world,' she said, adding that she had 'nothing' when she left but 'managed to get away' from the community 'without too much drama'. 'It's totally different to what you've lived before. 'You know nothing of just normal, everyday stuff - like renting a home, insurance, any of those types of things. 'Often people don't have their birth certificates or bank accounts. They don't even know how to spend money, how to buy things. 'There's birthday parties, Christmas - none of that was practised in the community... It's huge, adapting (to all of that).' The Ben Canaans will now be able to readily access personal technology, like mobile phones and have a television which they can watch without restrictions. Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - is the Australian evangelist who founded the Gloriavale commune after clashing with church leaders in New Zealand and Australia. In 1995, he spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges . Former Gloriavale residents tend to find it difficult to adapt from the outside world, a former resident told Daily Mail Australia.\\xa0'It's totally different to what you've lived before' The Ben Canaans no longer have to wear their Gloriavale 'uniform'. Instead, Miracle said they will now wear 'modest clothes'. The women in the family will also have to adjust to a world where make-up is worn regularly. Author Fleur Beale, who wrote the book\\xa0Sins of The Father\\xa0about the 1989 escape of Neville Cooper's son, Phil, and his family from the commune, said the biggest challenge the Ben Canaans would have would be financial, particularly given their 12 children. 'You can imagine what it's like trying to find a place to live with a family like that,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Gloriavale residents are often dubbed 'Cooperites'. Pictured is a Gloriavale wedding . The happy couple kiss as they are led from their wedding ceremony . 'You haven't been used to handling money or buying in a shop.\\xa0And what do you wear?' The details of the Ben Canaans' departure from Gloriavale remain unclear.\\xa0Miracle said the community was not surrounded with large walls, but: 'There are different types of walls... 'Psychological walls as well as physical barriers, but no access to telephones and long driveways to be able to leave.' A spokesman for the commune, Fervant Steadfast, told the New Zealand Herald last month the family had been permitted to depart. 'If they want to go and live in Timaru, well, that's their choice and that's what they need to do. 'No one is here against their will. We only want people who want to be here.' Nestled on the banks of the picturesque Lake Haipuri on New Zealand's rugged West Coast, Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The community, which isolates itself from the outside world, was founded by Neville Cooper, a Australian evangelist.\\xa0Cooper moved across the Tasman in 1969 with his wife, Gloria, and their ten children to found a Christian community. As its membership swelled, in 1991 they purchased land by the scenic lake to live off. Mr Cooper - a controversial figure who spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges in 1995 - would later change his name to 'Hopeful Christian'. Fleur Beale, the author of the Gloriavale book\\xa0Sins of the Father,\\xa0said the most striking thing about Gloriavale was the 'control those in power' - a group of elders - 'had over the ordinary people.' 'The women, particularly - it would be miserable to be a woman in Gloriavale,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Birth control is non-existent. 'God wants you to get married and have as many children as you can.\\xa0That's why they have big families.' Residents are required to wear a uniform. Women generally frock up in long, blue dresses - 'every single day', a former resident named Miracle told Daily Mail Australia. Meanwhile, men wear neckties, dark blue pants and a light blue sleeved shirt.\\xa0And while the personal use of technologies such as television and mobile phones is rare among 'ordinary people', Ms Beale said the community was 'very innovative', with extensive commercial operations. Residents do not take any wages, but work hard for the community's dairy and deer farms. The community consists of more than 80 families, according to Gloriavale's official website, and they live together in large, communal hostels.\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.5833466649055481, 0.41665327548980713]}\n",
            "{'sequence': \"The first farmers came to Europe 8,000 years ago and spread early agricultural practices, starting in Greece. But Northern Europeans during the Neolithic period, initially rejected the practice of farming, which was spreading throughout the rest of the continent, researchers claim. Their findings show a bump in the road in the adoption of farming, which enabled groups of people to move away from foraging and hunting as a means for survival and sparked a ‘major economic revolution’. Experts from Centre for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences (CIRHUS) in New York City studied neolithic ornaments (pictured) to understand how farming spread. These beads are examples of\\xa0personal ornaments worn by the first European farming societies . ‘This discovery goes beyond farming,’ said Solange Rigaud, the study's lead author and a researcher at the Centre for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences (CIRHUS) in New York City. ‘It also reveals two different cultural trajectories that took place in Europe thousands of years ago, with southern and central regions advancing in many ways and northern regions maintaining their traditions’. To come to their conclusion, the researchers looked at the adoption or rejection of ornamental beads or bracelets worn by different populations in the Early Neolithic period, which stretched from 8,000 to 5,000 BC. Based on discoveries of different types of Neolithic ornaments in different parts of Europe, they concluded that\\xa0Northern Europeans in the Neolithic period initially rejected the practice of farming, which was otherwise spreading throughout the continent. Examples of ornaments worn by European foraging societies are shown . Scientists recently discovered that stone-age hunter gatherers in England were trading with continental wheat farmers 8,000 years ago - long before agriculture came to Britain. Farming is thought to have arrived in Britain around 6,000 years ago so experts think that local hunter gatherers bought wheat by trading with European farmers from as far away as the south of France or the Balkans. This means that even 8,000 years ago there must have been trade routes winding their way across the European continent to Britain across an ancient land bridge. The scientists say that the discovery shows that Britain was no-where near as isolated or insular as had been originally thought. They say the findings may also force a complete rethink about how agriculture first arrived in Britain. Dr Robin Allaby, a plant geneticist at the University of Warwick who led the research, said: 'Eight thousand years ago the people of mainland Britain were leading a hunter-gatherer existence, whilst at the same time in southern Europeans farming was gradually spreading across Europe. Previous studies have shown a link between the embrace of survival methods and the adoption of particular ornaments, so by looking at the ornaments, the experts were able to understand the spread of farming practices for the first time. They examined some 200 bead-type objects found at more than 400 European sites over a 3,000-year period, tracing the adoption of ornaments linked to farming populations in order to explain the patterns of transition from foraging and hunting to farming. They found that the pathways of the spread of farming over 3,000 years, are less clear than previously thought. They found ornaments linked to farmers, such as human-shaped beads and bracelets composed of perforated shells, from eastern Greece and the Black Sea to France’s Brittany region and from the Mediterranean Sea northward to Spain. But the researchers did not find these types of ornaments in the Baltic region of northern Europe, according to the study, published in the journal Plos One. This area held on to decorative wear typically used by hunting and foraging populations, such as perforated shells rather than beads or bracelets found in farming communities. Dr Rigaud explained: ‘It's clear hunters and foragers in the Baltic area resisted the adoption of ornaments worn by farmers during this period. ‘We've therefore concluded that this cultural boundary reflected a block in the advancement of farming - at least during the Neolithic period.’ Their findings show a bump in the road of the adoption of farming, which enabled groups of people to move away from foraging and hunting as a means for survival and sparked a ‘major economic revolution’.

            "{'sequence': 'A warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into Western Europe 1.4 million years ago, a new study suggests. Researchers believe that the spread of our distant human ancestors, the hominins, had been halted by colder and drier temperatures. But as conditions warmed, they were able to branch out from Africa into Spain, and ultimately spread across Europe. Spanish researchers say climate change impacted human migration. Until 1.4 million years ago it was too cold to inhabit southeast Spain. But then the climate warmed to 13°C (55°F) and became more humid. This enabled hominins (stock image shown) - our distant ancestors - to move to new regions . The research was led by Dr Jordi Agusti from the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA). Published in the Journal of Human Evolution, the paper suggests climate change affected the amount of resources available. There have been various theories put forward over the years about the diet of our early ancestors, but a study from Oxford University published last year claimed to have finally settled the debate. An ancient human ancestor known as ‘Nutcracker Man’ lived mainly on a diet of tiger nuts, worms and grasshoppers, according to research. Scientists believe this diet explains why the ancient hominin relative, called Paranthropus boisei, which lived in East Africa between 2.4 and 1.4 million years ago, had such distinctively powerful jaws and large, flat molar teeth. The theory is based on analysis of the Barranco León site in the Guadix-Baza Basin in southeast Spain. Here, simple Oldowan tools have previously been found, linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago, reported Popular Archaeology. But they were not able to migrate to this region until conditions improved. The researchers said that the early Pleistocene era (the era lasted from 2.59 million to 11,700 years ago) was characterised by colder and drier weather. This ‘possibly impeded the settlement of this region by the early hominin population from the southern Caucasus,’ the researchers wrote. But shortly afterwards, ‘when the climatic conditions were again favourable, a hominin presence is suddenly evidenced.’ The theory is based on analysis of the Barranco León site in the Guadix-Baza Basin in southeast Spain, shown by the grey marker on this map. Here, simple Oldowan tools have previously been found, linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago . The Acheulean tool technology period - between 700,000 an 300,000 years ago - followed the more primitive Oldowan period. Tools at the time included large stone hand axes (stock image shown) made from flint and quartzite, used to scavenge from carcasses . It should be noted that the warming climate referred to here is on a vastly longer time scale than modern climate change. At the time 1.4 million years ago, though, temperatures warmed above 13°C (55°F) and humidity increased, allowing hominins to inhabit the region - scavenging carcasses in the region with the help of tools. ‘The data reported here clearly support the idea that the early hominin occupation of Europe was strongly constrained by climatic and environmental conditions, rather than by physiography or cultural factors,’ the researchers wrote.', 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.5258139967918396, 0.4741860628128052]}\n",

Harley Renshaw was diagnosed with cancer in his kidney, neck, lungs and bones. But his Ninja Turtle mask helped him feel stronger while he was having radiotherapy. Hospital staff were amazed when the youngster, from Stretford, asked if he could decorate the protective mask that holds him still while having his treatment. Harley Renshaw has been told he is cancer-free after battling an aggressive form of the disease for a year. He donned a superhero costume during his radiotherapy treatment, to help him feel brave . Harley asked if he could decorate the protective mask that holds him still while having his radiotherapy treatment like a Ninja Turtle . After Harley's story made headlines around the world, staff at children's TV channel Nickelodeon even sent Harley a box full of Ninja Turtle presents for Christmas. And now doctors given Harley's parents Oliver, 25, and Stacey, 23, the news they had not dared to dream of - he is free of cancer. He will undergo regular check-ups over the coming years to make sure he stays free of the disease. Mr Renshaw said: 'We're chuffed to bits. Harley is doing great. It was just over a year ago that he was diagnosed and he has been through it. 'He's been running about everywhere and we're hoping that he will soon be back at school full time.' Mr and Mrs Renshaw were given Harley's devastating diagnosis after taking him to see a doctor when he complained of a pain in his stomach. He was diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a rare and aggressive childhood cancer which affects fewer than 100 children in the UK. Harley was diagnosed with cancer in his kidney, lung, bones and neck after mother Stacey took him to a doctor with a stomach pain . Harley's story became famous after it was reported in the local paper in December last year. The children's TV channel Nickelodean even sent him a whole box of Ninja Turtles presents for Christmas . Neuroblastoma is cancer of specialised nerve cells, which are involved in the development of the nervous system. The tumours usually start in one of the adrenal glands found above the kidneys, or in nerve tissues that run along the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. As in Harley's case, the cancer can also spread to other areas of the body. After doctors diagnosed his tumour, Harley faced 80 days of intensive chemotherapy and an operation to remove his kidney tumour. A month later, he was back at hospital for a stem cell transplant – also called a blood or marrow transplant - where healthy stem cells were injected into his body to replace damaged or diseased stem cells. He suffered complications as a result of the procedure, but battled through them to return home for his fifth birthday. He also had weeks of radiotherapy at The Christie clinic in Manchester. Finally, he and his parents were given the incredible news that he was cancer-free. Harley's father said he is 'so chuffed' his son is cancer-free. 'Harley is doing great,' he said. 'He's been running about everywhere and we're hoping that he will soon be back at school full time' His bravery caught the attention of doctors in the hospital and he was awarded one of Cancer Research UK's Little Star Awards. He has also become the face of the charity's Kids and Teens Campaign, which aims to raise funds for research into child cancers. Mr Renshaw said Harley's family are overjoyed to be told he is free of cancer. He added: 'We're just really excited and looking forward to the future.'

Fewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with the disease. Most children diagnosed with the disease are younger than five years old. It is the second most common solid tumour in childhood, and it makes up 8 per cent of the total number of children's cancers. Neuroblastoma commonly occurs in either one of the two adrenal glands in a child's tummy or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. The cancer can spread to tissues beyond the original site, including bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver and skin. As with most cancers the cause of neuroblastoma is unknown. A neuroblastoma cancer cell in the brain is pictured under the microscope.\\xa0Fewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with this form of cancer . The symptoms vary depending on where a child's tumour is. The first signs can be vague, and include tiredness, a loss of appetite and pain in the bones. If the tumour is in a child's tummy, it may be swollen and the child may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine. Where a tumour is growing in a child's chest, they may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing. Tumours growing in the neck can be visible as a lump, and a child is likely to complain of breathing and swallowing problems. In cases where a tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children can experience a weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily. A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma. Treatment depends on the age of the child, as well as the size and position of the tumour and whether the disease has spread. Children can have surgery, chemotherapy, as well as antibody treatment and radiotherapy.

Jerry Grayson, who lives in Melbourne but is originally from Arundel, Sussex, set himself the task of tracking down every aircraft he ever flew as part of Royal Navy rescue missions during the 1970s. The 59-year-old, who now designs aerial stunts for films, was once the youngest pilot to join the navy and was responsible for saving 15 yachtsmen during the doomed Fastnet Yacht Race in 1979. Former Royal Navy rescue pilot Jerry Grayson, who was involved in rescuing sailors during the Fastnet Yacht Rescue in 1979 (pictured), has tracked down every aircraft he flew in during the 1970s . After travelling 23,000 miles, including from his home in Melbourne, Mr Grayson found that one of the choppers had been turned into a glamping unit - a popular style of camping for posh campers . The Wessex Mark 1 (pictured) now resides between a gypsy caravan and an old Routemaster bus in Blackberry Wood campsite near Ditchling, Sussex . During his mission, Mr Grayson found that most of the helicopters had been blown up in target practice or turned into museum pieces. But he discovered that one chopper, a Wessex Mark 1, has been kitted out as a so-called 'glamping' unit, accommodation for campers who want something more luxurious than a traditional tent. The Mark 1, called Wessex XS 886, now resides between a gypsy caravan and an old Routemaster bus in Blackberry Wood campsite near Ditchling, Sussex. Mr Grayson said: 'It's bizarre that it's now being used to sleep in. If I'd fallen asleep in a Mark 1 35 years ago, it would have cost me my life. It didn't feel like three decades ago that I'd last set foot inside. 'But when I looked at all the switches and dials I realised I can't remember how to start the thing.' Mr Grayson's journey took him all around the UK. He is pictured at the International Helicopter Museum in Weston-Super-Mare . He also tracked down another chopper at Gunsmoke Paintball in Hadleigh, near Ipswich - where it is used as part of the course . The tour also took him to another paintball site in Bawtry Fields, Doncaster, where he found another aircraft . The helicopter may be fitted with beds, curtains and cushioned seats. But, between 1977 and 1979, Mr Grayson flew in the aircraft for six rescues out of his base in Cornwall. He said: 'We used to save people from the cliff sides. Things like children in dinghies being blow out to sea or surfers suffering with the bends. 'Once we rescued a woman who had injured herself after falling off the cliff near a theatre. The whole cast of A Midsummer Night's Dream watched as we did it.' Mr Grayson, who is writing a book about his experiences, pictured with the helicopter in which he learned to fly at the age of 17 . The former pilot at Whittington Barracks, Staffordshire (left) and Taskforce Paintball, Cowbridge, South Wales . One of two helicopters that Mr Grayson found at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovilton . Mr Grayson's interest in retracing his old aircraft was piqued when he found a website, created by a former pilot, which spoke out previous experiences. The pair got in touch and began swapping stories. And as he dug deeper into the history of the helicopters, he decided to make one last visit to each one to see what had happened to them.

Its ideal location means the cabin is worth more than twice what a similar bolthouse would be worth elsewhere. It has 141,000 acres of forest surrounding the cabin . But its ideal location  means the cabin is worth more than twice what a similar bolthole would be worth elsewhere. For the same amount, buyers could own a three-bedroom Grade II-listed former school house just a few miles down the road in Ringwood. A four-bedroom detached bungalow with a huge garden in the New Forest town of Holbury is also for sale for £350,000. The aptly-named Log Cabin could be a suitable home for a small family or couple, with two bedrooms, a sizeable living room and a balcony which looks onto a south-facing garden.

The aptly-named Log Cabin could do for a small family, with two bedrooms, a sizeable living room (pictured), and a balcony which looks onto a south-facing garden . Despite looking like an ideal holiday retreat, the cabin also comes with permission to live in it all year round . The property was built in 2004 by the owners of the next door home who needed a place to stay while their house was refurbished. They are now selling the log cabin as they no longer need it. Kesia Whitfield, from estate agents Symonds and Sampson, said: 'The Log Cabin is down an unmade track. It's a no through road so it's very quiet and the owner would have direct access to picturesque forest walks from there. 'What's special about this one is you can live in it 365 days a year. They've got planning permission to live there all year round, not just for holiday lets.' She added: 'We think it will appeal to people looking for a New Forest bolthole or as an investment holiday let but also somebody who wants to live in the New Forest that hasn't got a huge budget. The property was built in 2004 by the owners of the next door home who needed a place to stay while their house was refurbished . Some 80 per cent of the enquiries have reportedly been from people who want to live in the cabin full-time .

'This is a great way to have your own little bit of the forest. You have got access to miles and miles of forest walks and spectacular far-reaching views over the forest heathland.'

She said:\\xa0'You might get similar holiday homes in holiday parks for half the price, but there you're on a camping site and you can only stay a certain amount of days.' According to property website Rightmove, the average price of a house in the New Forest is just shy of £370,000. The New Forest was created as a royal hunting enclave in 1079 when King William I, also known as William the Conquerer, wanted somewhere to hunt. Ten centuries on, the Forest is still largely in royal hands, with around 90 per cent of it belonging to the Crown. It became a National Park in 2005. The park, measuring 571 square kilometres, is set in a rough triangular shape across a large portion of Hampshire. It is bounded by Christchurch in the south west, Southampton in the east, and Fordingbridge and Redlynch in the north. A foal walking in the New Forest. The National Park in Hampshire is home to around 3,000 ponies . The forest is also famed for the New Forest pony, one of the recognised native breeds of the British Isles. There are estimated to be around 3,000 roaming the area. The countryside also boasts countless cycling and walking paths, as well as several decent museums and a host of famous country pubs. Bizarrely, the New Forest is also linked with one of Britain's most enduring mysteries. William Rufus, the Conqueror's son and successor, was shot and killed by a stray arrow while hunting in the Forest in 1100. Whether he was assassinated or  the victim of an accident remains a matter of debate. The Rufus Stone, a small memorial near Stoney Cross in the heart of the Forest, marks the spot where he reputedly fell.

            "{'sequence': \"Court battle: Lord Janner's alleged victims could sue him for £2.5million after the CPS dropped a prosecution against him for the fourth time . Lord Janner's alleged victims could sue him for £2.5million after being denied justice for the fourth time in 25 years when the CPS refused to prosecute him. Police have identified 25 people who claim the Labour peer attacked them and each could claim for up to £100,000. One man, allegedly attacked by Janner when he was living in a  children's homes between 1981 and 1988, has already instructed lawyers to sue him and Leicestershire County Council for damages. His solicitor Peter Garsden, president of the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, has said that after a string of bungled investigations suing 'may be the only way the alleged victims are going to get some sort of justice'. Several of those who claim to have been sexually abused say Janner got to them through paedophile Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children's homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. The CPS last week said the 'core allegation' was that Lord Janner befriended Beck to access children 'to allow him to perpetrate serious sexual offences' on them. Beck died in jail in 1994. Mr Garsden said: 'We are preparing a claim for this man against Lord Janner and Leicestershire County Council. 'The allegations involved the most extreme abuse. Our case is that Frank Beck was running the home where this man was introduced to Greville Janner. 'Perhaps this is the only way the alleged victims in this case are going to get some sort of justice.' A compensation scheme for Jimmy Savile's dozens of victims was agreed at the High Court last year where those abused were paid out of his £3.3million estate. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July\\xa08 2014, when he was last seen in public . Test cases: Victims abused by Jimmy Savile and Liberal MP Cyril Smith also sued after they were denied justice . Liz Dux, whose law firm Slater & Gordon respresents 168 of Jimmy Savile's victims and 10 of former Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith, says that Janner's alleged victims could be handed £100,000 each. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs have accused Alison Saunders, the director of the CPS (above), of ignoring the rights of victims . Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who made the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner, claimed £13,400 in expenses last year including almost £7,000 on business-class flights. Her most recently published expenses show she flew business class to Washington, Dubai and New York in the year that the CPS was forced to cut its budget by 27 per cent. Mrs Saunders, pictured, has been heavily criticised in recent weeks over corruption charges against journalists and deciding not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged sex offences. The publicly funded trips included one to the Caribbean for an ‘official meeting’ last September which cost the taxpayer £3,105 for hotels and flights. A CPS spokesman said: ‘The DPP’s travel overseas helps the CPS to join forces with other countries so we can reduce serious crime both in the UK and around the world.’ The CPS said the DPP travels standard fares unless there is a long-haul trip and a requirement to work immediately at the other end. Mrs Saunders, who earns £200,000 a year, charged the taxpayer £102 for one taxi journey. The CPS said they have strict rules on when taxis should be used, including when heavy baggage has to be carried or when there are no other suitable methods of transportation. She said: 'If the victims of Lord Janner are successful, damages could be sizeable. 'Civil redress is the next logical step after the CPS decision.' Lord Janner's family has said he is 'entirely innocent of any wrongdoing' and 'is a man of great integrity'. A Leicestershire County Council spokesman said: 'We have been co-operating with the police on aspects of their investigation that relate to historic abuse involving the former county council children's homes in the 1970s and 1980s. 'Since then, the council has introduced a series of safeguards and procedures to minimise the chances of this kind of abuse from happening again. All relevant documents have been provided to the police. 'We have not been approached so far regarding compensation claims and so cannot comment further at this time.' The CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. However, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. She spoke of her 'deep regret' as she announced that Lord Janner will not face trial and admitted he should have been charged three times before in 1991, 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook. Last night it emerged that Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. Leicestershire Police, who disagree with the decision not to charge Janner having investigated him for the past two years, have admitted they may contact the House of Lords about the letter.

In an attempt to reduce its prison population, California has recently introduced the Elderly Parole Program which allows a parole hearing from inmates older than 60 who have served at least 25 years. But the parole board at Corcoran State Prison, where Hooker is incarcerated, denied the request and have stated the inmate won\\'t get another hearing for 15 years. Luis Patino, a spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said Hooker had been given the longest delay period until his next parole hearing as the board found he was \\'far from suitable\\' for being released.

At other times she would be forced into another, coffin-like box under Hooker and his wife\\xa0Janice\\'s\\xa0bed, or tied to a rack. The specially-made torture device caused permanent damage to her back and one shoulder. She was also forced to sign a \\'slavery contract\\' which meant she had to do anything Hooker wanted, from sex to the more mundane such as household chores or looking after his children. In 1978, Janice gave birth to a second baby on the water bed above Stan. Hooker had convinced her that if she ever ran away a powerful organisation known as The Company would find her, and would hurt her family. To avoid painful punishments, she said she tried to be a good slave and that due to this she was allowed out to jog, work in the yard, and care for the Hooker children alone in the mobile home.

Even with an open door, neighbors, and a telephone, Stan made no attempt to escape; she said that her fear of \"The Company\" kept her from seeking help. Neighbors for years believed she was she just the family\\'s helper. In 1981 she was even allowed to visit her family alone but then returned to Hooker, such was the extent to which she was under his control and feared \\'The Company\\'. In 1984 she she was allowed to take a job as a maid at a local hotel. The turning point came in 1984 when Hooker told his wife Janice that he wanted to make Stan his second wife and bring in more female slaves. She told Stan that Hooker wasn\\'t part of The Company and helped her to escape. Stan called Hooker from the bus stop and told him she was leaving him. He was said to have burst into tears. Despite escaping his clutches she continued to call him and refused to report him to the police. She said she wanted to give him the chance to reform. Once back home, Stan went to school for an accounting degree, married, and had a daughter. She also joined an organization to help abused women. It was his wife Janice who finally went to the police and in return for immunity agreed to testify against him.

Swap your towel for a weighted, waterproof blanket and say goodbye to sticky sand all over your belongings . Ditch your towel . A waterproof blanket is much more effective than a towel, particularly if you're setting up camp in the sand. When towels get damp, it's nearly impossible to keep sand from sticking to them - and you - and if there's any wind whatsoever, they're nearly bound to blow away. Instead, a weighted waterproof option will stay put and dry during all your dips in the sea. The best way to ensure you don't wind up with a water-logged mobile phone is by using resealable plastic bags . Stock up on resealable bags .

Screw the lid back on to hold it in place, and eliminate all worries about bursting liquids . 6. Wrap breakables, such as perfume bottles, or a teacup if you are Miranda Kerr, in socks to protect them . 7. Keep freebie shampoos and cosmetics from hotels so you don't have to lug big bottles . 8.

Traditionally known as a 'naatsit', the underwear is adorned with beads and would have been sewn together by a woman using strips of seal pelt. It is currently on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen as part of its animal-skin clothing collection. Traditionally known as a 'naatsit', the underwear (pictured) is adorned with beads and would have been sewn together by a woman, for a woman, using strips of seal pelt. It is currently on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen as part of its animal-skin clothing collection . Peter Toft, the National Museum of Denmark's Greenlandic fur clothing expert, told Ella Morton at\\xa0Atlas Obscura\\xa0the underwear would have been worn inside the homes of the Inuit - even in front of guests or when visiting family members. It was obtained during an expedition to the Ammassalik settlement in Greenland in 1892 by Captain C. Ryder. When leaving the settlement, the female wearer would have worn it under trousers. The naatsit was the only undergarment the Inuit would have worn next to their bare skin and it was often decorated with beads of glass, with the seal fur turned outside. Example have also been decorated with small pieces of fur in different colours. It was obtained during an expedition to the Ammassalik settlement in Greenland in 1892 by Captain C. Ryder. When leaving a settlement, the female wearer would have worn this naastit (pictured) under trousers . Seals are found along the coast of East Greenland and are hunted by Inuits (stock image) for their meat and skin. Seal fur provides less insulation than caribou fur to prevents the wearer from sweating and causing the material to become damp, and later freeze in the cold . Cunera Buijs from the National Museum of Ethnology said: 'When weather conditions permitted, the naatsit was often the only garment worn, both in the home and outside in the settlement.' These homes would have been built to keep in the heat, with a low corridor entrance positioned in such a way to cause warm air to rise from beneath the structure into the home, and stay there. In addition to the naatsit, the National Museum of Denmark's collection also features a diaper made from reindeer fur (pictured) Many of these primitive buildings would have housed more than one family. 'There does seem to have been a taboo against walking around outside the home only in shorts,' continued Ms Buijs. 'As soon as the Inuit men left their own settlement, they put on a pair of long trousers made of seal or polar-bear fur.' Seals are found along the coast of East Greenland and are hunted for their meat and skin. Inuits across the region, and into North America and Siberia, would have also made garments from the skin and fur of reindeer and caribou. The severe conditions of the region means that clothes have to protect against the cold, wind and damp and seal fur, in particular, provides less insulation than caribou fur. This prevents the wearer from sweating and causing the material to become damp, and later freeze in the cold, continued Mr Toft. Women would clean the skin and remove all traces of flesh to prevent them from rotting, a pricess called 'flensing'. The fat would be scraped away on a board called a qapiarpik and the clothing would have been sewn together using a sakkeq or ulu - a traditional woman’s knife - and a needle. The display also contains a pair of pantyhose made from reindeer skin and fur (pictured).\\xa0A similar collection is on display at the National Museum of Ethnology, which came via the museum in Copenhagen . In 17th century Iceland, sorcerers wore 'trousers' made of a dead friend's skin that were said to bring them wealth (example pictured) In 17th century Iceland, sorcerers wore 'trousers' made of a dead friend's skin that were said to bring them wealth. According to legend, a morbid deal was struck between two friends to arrange who became the trousers or 'necropants,' which were used for purposes of traditional magic at the time. The Museum of Icelandic Sorcery & Witchcraft in Holmavik, Iceland, houses the only known intact pair of necropants, that were meant to be worn day and night by their owner. In order to make the necropants (called nábrók in the naive tongue) an individual had to get permission from a living man to use his skin after his death. The surviving member of the pact had to dig up his dead friend's body and peel off the skin of the corpse from the waist down in one piece without any holes or scratches, to make the magical trousers. As soon as they stepped into the pants, the skin of the corpse stuck to theirs own, according to the museum, which documents 17th century occult practices. To make the grim garment, the wearer of the pants had to steal a coin from a poor widow at Christmas, Easter or Whitson and place it in the scrotum of the trousers, along with the magical sign called nábrókarstafur, which is drawn on a piece of paper. The coin is a 'tool to gather wealth by supernatural means,' according to the spokesman. It drew money into the scrotum from living people so 'it will never be empty' as long as the original coin is not removed, according to folklore. Many of these techniques and tools are used today. When Europeans arrived in East Greenland from the end of the 19th century they introduced new materials, and modern-day garments are often a mixture of old techniques and newer fabrics. In addition to the naatsit, the National Museum of Denmark's collection also features a diaper and a pair of pantyhose made from reindeer skin and fur. A similar collection is on display at the National Museum of Ethnology, which came via the museum in Copenhagen. During the 1930s, Dutch biologist and Nobel Prize winner, Niko Tinbergen, lived in East Greenland and collected objects of ethnographic interest. He donated an East Greenland kayak and two kayak anoraks to the museum of ethnology. Many other items were provided by Gerti Nooter from the 1970s who conducted research in North America and the arctic region.

            "{'sequence': \"Voters are still 'in the dark' about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day, economic experts warned today. Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given 'anything like full details' on how they will tackle the nations' debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving 'no detail' about their deficit reduction plan, which relies on £30billion of cuts, while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra £26billion-a-year. Scroll down for video . The\\xa0Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on 'almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases'. The think-tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May's General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. 'Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. 'But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. 'While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition, its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year.' Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly £3 billion. Borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was £87.3 billion for the year to the end of March, down from £98.5 billion in 2013/14, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The result undershot the latest target of £90.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the time of last month's Budget. It means that annual borrowing (GDP) has fallen by more than £60 billion from £153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, underlying debt of £1.48 trillion is more than £500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of £956 billion. The nation's debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP, up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya Keynes said: 'The Conservatives have said they want to eliminate the deficit but provided next to no detail on how they would do it. 'They should be forthcoming on the £5 billion of largely unspecified clampdown on tax avoidance, the £10 billion of unspecified cuts to social security spending and, according to our calculations, further real cuts to unprotected departments of around £30 billion.' Turning to Labour, the IFS said the Opposition had been 'considerably more vague' about how much it wants to borrow. The pledge to produce a surplus but without specifying by when or how much could be consistent with a reduction in borrowing totalling 3.6 per cent of national income. Senior research economist Rowena Crawford said: 'Labour's proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest. 'But this would leave borrowing at £26billion a year in today's terms. 'If Labour wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there.' The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017-18, revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. The SNP's figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as Labour, the IFS said, although the reduction would be slower. This means the SNP is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity, the think-tank said. The independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy, with Labour accusing the Tories of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world's advanced economies and the Conservatives renewing warnings that Britain's economy would suffer from an 'SNP/Miliband nightmare'. Labour's Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party, with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years. 'The Tories might be able to make the cuts but the last five years show they will fail to cut the deficit as they claim. They have borrowed £200 billion more than they planned because their failure to boost living standards has led to tax revenues falling short.' But Mr Osborne today warned that every family in the country will be left £350 worse off if the SNP is left calling the shots in a Labour government. The Chancellor warned of a 'dangerous cocktail' if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. With polls showing no party will win an overall majority, Mr Osborne claimed it would spark a 'constitutional crisis' if Scottish nationalist MPs held the balance of power in the UK government. Launching the SNP manifesto this week, Ms Sturgeon named her price for supporting Labour in any post-election deal. She demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK, raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. And she unveiled a £140billion 'ransom note' for Britain to drag Labour to the left, including an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. Mr Osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that Treasury analysis suggests it would add £6billion to Britain's interest bill, worth £350 per family. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's a new feature of this election that a Labour party cannot win an overall majority, so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of Scottish Nationalists. 'We've got a strong plan for a national recovery, but it's perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what Gordon Brown described last night as 'constitutional chaos'. 'The Scottish Nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a Labour minority government propped up by them.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The politicians seeking our votes owe it to taxpayers to come clean about what spending the country can, and cannot, afford. 'This candour has so far been noticeably absent in the election campaign, with politicians failing to acknowledge the dire state of the public finances and instead clambering over each other to make additional and apparently unfunded spending pledges.'

Doug Hughes, 61, is 'lucky to be alive' and 'should have been blown out of the air,' Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight committee, told reporters just days after the incident that exposed a gap in the government's efforts to ensure the security of the White House, Capitol and other critical buildings in Washington.

Press conference: Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, left, and ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummins, D-Md., speak with reporters on Wednesday . Pilot: The man who piloted the gyrocopter and landed on the West Lawn, 61-year-old Doug Hughes, is 'lucky to be alive' and 'should have been blown out of the air,' Chaffetz said . Campaign: Hughes' stunt was aimed at drawing attention to campaign finance reform . Chaffetz said security tracked Hughes as he approached the Capitol last week after taking off from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A 'judgment call' was made not to shoot Hughes down, Chaffetz said. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said officials were concerned about injuring people on the ground if an attempt was made to shoot down Hughes. Chaffetz said a combination of 'lack of communication and some human error' by Capitol Police and other officials allowed Hughes to steer his tiny aircraft within a few hundred feet of the Capitol before landing on the West Lawn. Chaffetz said he was deeply concerned at 'a lack of coordination and communication' among law enforcement agencies charged with what he called 'a no-fail mission' to protect the Capitol and other important sites in Washington, including the White House. Cummings called the incident a 'wake-up call' to all law enforcement agencies involved. Capitol Police, the Secret Service and other agencies need 'to look very carefully at what happened here, dissect it, figure it out and use this to make things better,' Cummings said. Cummings and Chaffetz said they were outraged that members of Congress were not alerted to the potential security threat even as parts of the Capitol complex were placed under lockdown. 'That's inexcusable,' Chaffetz said. Chaffetz and Cummings said they will hold a hearing on the incident next week with representatives of six agencies: the Secret Service, Capitol Police, Congress' Sergeant at Arms, the Federal Aviation Administration, North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the U.S. Park Police. Three of the agencies - the FAA, NORAD and the park police - were no-shows at Wednesday's briefing, irking lawmakers. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said officials were concerned about injuring people on the ground if an attempt was made to shoot down Hughes . Security: Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said last week that Hughes 'literally flew under the radar' to the Capitol lawn, but added that it's too soon to say whether security changes are needed . Issues:\\xa0Hughes was charged with two federal crimes, violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft. The crimes carry penalties of up to four years in prison and fines . 'They've got a lot of explaining to do' about why they did not attend the briefing, Chaffetz said. Lawmakers were told during the briefing that 'incursions' into the restricted air space around Washington occur nearly every day and are usually 'dealt with in a smooth and professional manner,' Chaffetz said, in stark contrast to the gyrocopter incident. Lawmakers raised alarms about security after Hughes' stunt, which was aimed at drawing attention to campaign finance reform. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said last week that Hughes 'literally flew under the radar' to the Capitol lawn, but added that it's too soon to say whether security changes are needed. 'We are a democracy.

Chaffetz said there is a 'heightened awareness' about the risks of small aircraft in the wake of the gyrocopter stunt. Anyone who enters restricted airspace now will have 'a major problem,' Cummings said. Hughes was charged with two federal crimes, violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft.

            "{'sequence': \"Bruce Jenner has confirmed he started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s but stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife. The 65-year-old told Diane Sawyer he embarked on hormone therapy and electrolysis, and had plastic surgery to make his features look more feminine, shortly after winning the Olympic gold. However, he says, he stopped out of 'fear' of publicity and shame, and kept his secret to himself until he couldn't bear it any longer. Scroll down for video . Early signs?  Bruce Jenner has revealed he started having hormone therapy and plastic surgery in the mid to late 1980s to make himself look more feminine. He's shown here in September 1987 . Before the changes: Bruce, seen here on set, still had his athletic physique and heavy set masculine features when he appeared in the 1980 film Can't Stop The Music. These were noticeably gone by the end of the decade . Bruce said he was exploring the idea of gender reassignment surgery with doctors in Denmark but had a change of heart after meeting Kris, the ex-wife of famed LA attorney Robert Kardashian. On Friday night, he publicly addressed about his personal journey and his transition to living as a woman in a two-hour ABC special tonight with Diane Sawyer. As the romance between Bruce and Kris blossomed in late 1990 and early 1991, the former star athlete  halted hormone therapy and underwent breast reduction surgery. The couple married months after meeting on April 21, 1991, and went on to have two children together - Kendall, now 19, and Kylie, 17, - before divorcing in December last year. Change of heart: Bruce halted his gender transition after meeting Kris Kardashian in late 1990. He stopped hormone injections and even underwent breast reduction surgery before the couple married. \\xa0He's seen here with Kris in February 1993 . Family man: \\xa0Bruce and Kris tied the knot in April 1991 just months after meeting. Seen here in 2000 with their daughters Kendall and Kylie, the couple were married for 22 years. Bruce found fame again with a whole new generation thanks to the reality series about their blended family Keeping Up With The Kardashians . A source quoted by Entertainment Tonight says that Bruce was greatly influenced by the life story of transgender tennis player Renee Richards. Richards, born a boy Richard Raskind in 1934, underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1975. In 1976, she launched a legal challenge after the US Tennis Association denied her permission to compete as a woman in the U.S. Open because she had not been born a woman and in 1977 the New York Supreme Court ruled in her favor in a landmark decision for transsexual rights. It's believed that her autobiography Second Serve, published in 1983, had a significant influence on Bruce. In 1986, the book was made into a TV movie starring Vanessa Redgrave who received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Inspiration: Transgender tennis player Renee Richards won the right to complete as a woman in the 1977 U.S. Open after winning a landmark legal battle. Richards was born a boy in 1934 . Textbook transition: It's suggested that Bruce was greatly influenced by Richards' life story as outlined in her 1983 autobiography Second Serve. The Kardashian-Jenner patriarch and reality TV star addressed his gender journey during the two-hour prime time special airing tonight on ABC. He says: 'I wanna know how this story ends, you know? How does my story end?' In a message of support, TV's Dr. Phil told ET on Thursday that he's happy for the Olympian. 'This is his body and his life, and he needs to do what he wants to do,' said Dr. Phil. 'It drains your spirit if you can't be yourself. He is freeing himself.' The interview was conducted before Jenner was involved in an auto accident in which another motorist was killed. Nervous: Bruce Jenner is seen greeting Diane Sawyer at his home in the latest promo video released Thursday ahead of the airing of his sit-down interview in which he is expected to address his gender transition . Resolute: The former decathlete tells the journalist that it is 'going to be an emotional rollercoaster but somehow I'm gonna get through it' Looking to the future: The clip released Thursday concluded with Bruce asking, 'how does my story end?'

In her new book, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, the 40-year-old\\xa0said she was shocked her revelation garnered so much attention from the media, with interview requests flooding in from news organisations all over the world. After being labelled ‘a whore and a s*** and an anti-feminist’, Ms Goff said the most troubling part of her ‘coming out’ experience was the response she received from other mothers, who expected her children to ‘endure a life of misery’ because of her abnormal profession. Scroll down for video . Former journalist Amanda Goff appeared on a TV show in LA about sex and relationships and defended her decision to reveal her identity as escort Samantha X . ‘The fact I had kids caused a torrent of vitriolic abuse spouting from the thinly pursed lips of apparently ‘better’ mothers than me who thought my role in society was awful, tutting my ‘poor, poor’ children and raging about what a terrible, selfish mother I was, and how because of my job, my kids would have to endure a life of misery, bullying and shame (probably from their own kids),’ she wrote. Although Ms Goff, who has worked at New Idea, InStyle and Prevention magazines, knew her story would one day become ‘old news’, she said she felt physically sick in the weeks following her revelation. After a stern talking to from a close friend, Ms Goff said she decided to ‘toughen up’ and start focusing on the people in her life who she thought really mattered.

Not only did Ms Goff receive support from those who wanted to follow in her footsteps, she was also commended for her strength and courage by women who already worked in the sex industry. While she copped a lot of flack for admitting she worked in the sex industry, Ms Goff said her job as a sex worker, was more ethical than her former career as a journalist where she was asked to hide in bushes and illegally hack phones.

'I consider myself an athletic guy, but have never been . flexible and didn't like the thought of embarrassing myself in . front of a group of women,' said financial analyst and Broga enthusiast Eric Wright, . 22, from San Jose, California. Founder: Robert Sidoti (pictured) is the creator and co-Founder of Broga . Eric and his male colleagues use the video streaming . service Grokker, which is aimed at broadcasting fitness, food and yoga classes directly to your home or office, to partake in their weekly yoga sessions. 'On Wednesdays we have a standing Broga appointment and . anywhere from five to eight others will join me,' he said. Grokker founder and CEO Lorna Borenstein said more men . are adding yoga to their exercise routines as a cross-training . tool for flexibility and improving recovery time. Even if they spend most of their time focusing on more high intensity gym training, men are now using yoga as a useful warm-up method. 'Men are a little late to the party,' she said.

Popular: More gyms are devoting resources and dedicated studio space to Broga programs . 'A lot of guys were saying 'I can't touch my knees, let alone my toes. I would never go to a mostly women class and do things I'm no good at,' said Sidoti, whose sequences are designed with men's bodies in mind. 'We rarely go into poses that require deep forward bending, . twisting and binding,' he said, adding that a High Intensity Interval . Training (HIIT) sequence is included in his standard workout. Broga talk is also anatomically driven, rather than focusing on the mind and the soul like many traditional yoga classes do. 'It's not so much about feeling your heart center as feeling . the stretch across your chest,' Sidoti explained.

'They celebrate the physical,' said Matthews, who is also a . yoga teacher. Wright said Broga has improved his hamstring flexibility. 'Four months ago I couldn't touch my toes and today I can . almost reach my palms to the ground,' he said.\", 'labels': ['about sports', 'not about sports'], 'scores': [0.5394506454467773, 0.46054932475090027]}\n"
