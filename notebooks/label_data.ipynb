              " {'sequence': '(CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC\\'s founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians\\' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday\\'s ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court\\'s treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \"What\\'s objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine\\'s decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court\\'s decision. \"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

              " {'sequence': 'Norfolk, Virginia (CNN)The second mate of the Houston Express probably couldn\\'t believe what he was seeing. Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. \"He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition,\" Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday. That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He\\'d been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn\\'t fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" Jordan said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN\\'s Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. \"He looked good. Hadn\\'t lost too much weight. He wasn\\'t badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be,\" he said. Lost at sea for 66 days . After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn\\'t cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren\\'t cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jordan came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan\\'s incredible story. They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing. Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son\\'s appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. His son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal. \"I know he went through what he went through,\" Frank Jordan said. Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. He had free rent and free food in the river, he said. But when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. Frank Jordan told CNN\\'s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He\\'s got a very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan said. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land. \"You would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him,\" he said. \"But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing.\" Grenz was also surprised by Jordan\\'s condition, physically and mentally. The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. \"We took him to a rescue boat,\" the container ship captain said. \"He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again.\" Derriel Morris, a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina & RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat, named \"Angel.\" Morris said: \"It was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat.\" Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. But when he returned to the marina, Jordan had slipped away. \"There was no shore line, no hose; it was like he was never there,\" Morris told the station. After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. The marina\\'s manager, Jeff Weeks, told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Police in the Indian city of Malegaon, in the western state of Maharashtra, are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents: Cattle. Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef, authorities in the city have asked residents to take a \\'mugshot\\' of their cattle and submit it to the police. Along with the photograph, the residents have to give information about their animal\\'s \\'unique features,\\' such as the coloring and age of the cow, along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law. Cows are considered holy and revered by that state\\'s majority Hindu population. \"We are creating a database. If we get an information of a cow slaughter, we can quickly go to the resident\\'s place and check whether it is there or not\", Mahesh Sawai, Deputy Superintendent of Malegaon Police told CNN. \"I believe this will be very effective\" So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed. The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in Malegaon, where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat. The Maharashtra Animal Preservation Bill now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses. Even the consumption or sale of beef could now land you in prison for five years. The slaughter of buffaloes, however, is still permissible. However, beef traders in the country strongly reacted to the decision and called a month-long strike, which ended Wednesday. The traders refused to even slaughter buffaloes and deprive the state of all bovine meat. They have now vowed to file a case in the state\\'s high court. Red meat lovers weren\\'t too delighted either, arguing the government doesn\\'t have a right to interfere in an individual\\'s personal preference. Maharashtra is not the only Indian state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter. Haryana state has implemented a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison, the toughest penalty in the country. Rajnath Singh, India\\'s Home Minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country-wide law against cow slaughter.',\n",

The chilly continent recorded the temperature (15.5 degrees Celsius) on March 24, possibly the highest ever recorded on Antarctica, according to the Weather Underground. The temperature was recorded at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctica Peninsula, according to CNN affiliate WTNH. (Note to map lovers: The Argentine base is not geographically part of the South American continent.) The World Meteorological Organization, a specialized United Nations agency, is in the process of setting up an international ad-hoc committee of about 10 blue-ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence, said Randy Cerveny, the agency's lead rapporteur of weather and climate extremes and Arizona State University professor of geographical sciences. The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations, Cerveny said. The committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to Cerveny, who will make an official finding, probably by late summer or early fall.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, \"(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia.\" The Columbia team concluded that \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine\\'s managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, \"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to \\'pursue all available legal action\\' The next question is: . Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that \"the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent.\" \"Actionable\" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \"true.\" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person\\'s reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that\\'s only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let\\'s eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you\\'re going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it\\'s hard to say the statement is \"concerning\" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group\\'s individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about \"a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue.\" If I said, \"The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals\" (they weren\\'t),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn\\'t. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the \"small group\" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone\\'s lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity\\'s reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that\\'s likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That\\'s because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you\\'re going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms\\' basements and are \"between jobs,\" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won\\'t be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.',\n",

The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Cedar Falls, Iowa (CNN)As aides politely tried to rush Ted Cruz from an event in Cedar Falls to one in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Thursday, the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him. Finally, after the selfies and conversations started to die down, his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall, burly man stopped him. \"Senator,\" he said, \"can I pray with you real quick?\" \"Yeah,\" Cruz said, as he clasped the man\\'s upper arm and the two bowed their heads. It was one of the many moments when Cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week, as the senator from Texas hit the trail in Iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate. Being the only official contender in the race, Cruz drew large crowds during his two-day swing across the state. He\\'s counting on Iowa, known for its vocal and active evangelical base, to propel him forward in what\\'s expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of GOP candidates. Cruz, himself, displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room. The senator regularly avoids using a podium, instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone, a scene reminiscent of a Sunday morning sermon. When he meets with people after events, he embraces each one\\'s hand with both of his, softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye -- a familiar interaction between churchgoing Christians and their pastors. The past two winners of Iowa\\'s caucuses rose to victory with support from the Christian right, and Cruz, who announced his bid last month at the well-known Baptist school Liberty University, is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize. Evangelicals make up a large segment of Iowa\\'s Republican voter bloc. According to a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll from January, 44% of likely 2016 Republican caucus-goers said they were born-again or evangelical Christians. Cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck GOP leadership on fiscal issues, but he showed in Iowa last week that he\\'s also eager to champion social issues at a time when many Republicans are anxious to avoid them. He was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in Indiana, which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians. He described the outrage over the laws as \"shameful\" and an \"assault\" on First Amendment rights. \"There are a lot of people here in Iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking, watching what has happened in the last two weeks,\" Cruz said Friday night at an event in Des Moines. \"We have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty.\" RELATED: Republican 2016 hopefuls back Indiana\\'s \\'religious freedom\\' law . He\\'s more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a Christian and a pastor. Rafael Cruz, who\\'s become a celebrity among Christian conservatives, will frequently visit Iowa over the next year, Cruz told voters. And Cruz\\'s Iowa director, Bryan English, is a former pastor. Cruz\\'s first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on Fox News and NBC that are pegged to Easter Sunday. In the ad, Cruz talks about the impact of the \"transformative love of Jesus Christ\" on his life. While neither Mike Huckabee, who won Iowa in 2008, nor Rick Santorum, who won in 2012, went on to win the nomination, their successes helped launch them into high-profile battles with the then-front-runners. And with both of them likely running again in 2016, the competition will be stiff. That\\'s why, for Cruz, courting evangelicals is only a component of a three-pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base. His stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction. He received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the IRS, and, in a knock against the National Security Agency, he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so President Obama \"can hear every word I have to say.\" Cruz argued Thursday that the Republican Party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the Ron Paul-Rand Paul faction of the party -- young libertarian-minded voters -- and the Santorum base -- evangelicals. The two blocs, he said, are \"not necessarily the best of chums.\" \"If we\\'re going to win, we\\'ve got to bring that coalition together,\" he said in Cedar Falls. \"And I think we can do that.\" Cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels, when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election, a higher than normal turnout for the demographic. That number has waned slightly since 2004 -- but it\\'s not too far off from the 56% of the overall population that voted in 2012. Still, his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who\\'ve been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform, then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls. \"If you look at available places for the party to expand the vote, it doesn\\'t exist in the middle, it exists in the evangelical vote,\" said Rick Tyler, a top Cruz adviser. \"It isn\\'t a pond, it\\'s an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative.\" Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says. Moore points to hot-button topics like religious freedom issues in the U.S., as well as increased attention to the killing of minority Christians in the Middle East and rising anti-Semitism. \"I don\\'t think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith,\" Moore said. \"I think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good.\" Later in April, voters in Iowa will see the bulk of the GOP field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. While the past two winners of the Iowa caucuses -- Santorum and Huckabee -- are likely running for president again, Steve Scheffler, president of the group, argued that the field is wide open in terms of who\\'s going to win favor among evangelicals. Jeb Bush, while not popular among conservative activists, was known for his staunch anti-abortion record as Florida governor and touts his Catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views. Scott Walker is the son of a pastor. Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the Obama administration at a national prayer breakfast. And other likely candidates -- from Marco Rubio to Rick Perry to Rand Paul -- have made serious efforts to court the religious right. \"It\\'s up for grabs.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Anthony Ray Hinton is thankful to be free after nearly 30 years on Alabama\\'s death row for murders he says he didn\\'t commit. And incredulous that it took so long. Hinton, 58, looked up, took in the sunshine and thanked God and his lawyers Friday morning outside the county jail in Birmingham, minutes after taking his first steps as a free man since 1985. He spoke of unjustly losing three decades of his life, under fear of execution, for something he didn\\'t do. \"All they had to do was to test the gun, but when you think you\\'re high and mighty and you\\'re above the law, you don\\'t have to answer to nobody,\" Hinton told reporters. \"But I\\'ve got news for you -- everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God.\" Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Laura Petro had ordered Hinton released after granting the state\\'s motion to dismiss charges against him. Hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two Birmingham-area, fast-food restaurant managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason. But a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver Hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case, and the two killings couldn\\'t be linked to each other. \"Death Row Stories\": Hard questions about the U.S. capital punishment system . The state then declined to re-prosecute the case. Hinton was 29 at the time of the killings and had always maintained his innocence, said the Equal Justice Initiative, a group that helped win his release. \"Race, poverty, inadequate legal assistance, and prosecutorial indifference to innocence conspired to create a textbook example of injustice,\" Bryan Stevenson, the group\\'s executive director and Hinton\\'s lead attorney, said of his African-American client. \"I can\\'t think of a case that more urgently dramatizes the need for reform than what has happened to Anthony Ray Hinton.\" Stevenson said the \"refusal of state prosecutors to re-examine this case despite persuasive and reliable evidence of innocence is disappointing and troubling.\" Amnesty report: Executions down but death sentences on the rise . Dressed in a dark suit and blue shirt, Hinton praised God for his release, saying he was sent \"not just a lawyer, but the best lawyers.\" He said he will continue to pray for the families of the murder victims. Both he and those families have suffered a miscarriage of justice, he said. \"For all of us that say that we believe in justice, this is the case to start showing, because I shouldn\\'t have (sat) on death row for 30 years,\" he said. Woman who spent 22 years on death row has case tossed . Hinton was accompanied Friday by two of his sisters, one of whom still lives in the Birmingham area. Other siblings will fly to the area to see him soon, Stevenson said. His mother, with whom he lived at the time of his arrest, is no longer living, according to the lawyer. Hinton planned to spend at least this weekend at the home of a close friend. He will meet with his attorneys Monday to start planning for his immediate needs, such as obtaining identification and getting a health checkup, Stevenson said. The plan now is to spend a few weeks to get oriented with freedom and \"sort out what he wants to do,\" Stevenson said.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Waterloo, Iowa (CNN)Martin O\\'Malley and Jim Webb share little in common. Both Democrats are toying with a presidential run, both are facing long odds in that endeavor, and both shared a stage at the Polk County Democrats Awards Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Friday night. But, as was evident at the dinner, that is where the similarities end. O\\'Malley is a former mayor and Maryland governor who seems most at home when he is pressing the flesh at events and introducing himself to anyone who would extend their hand. Webb, on the contrary, is a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former senator from Virginia who comes across as more stoic and, at times, uncomfortable with retail politics. Before the event, O\\'Malley confidently cruised the union hall. He took selfies with young environmental activists and chatted with sometimes tepid supporters who admitted their other political allegiances. \"It is a marathon, not a sprint,\" one man told O\\'Malley, a nod to his long odds in the 2016 Democratic nomination process. \"Yes, it is; it\\'s a marathon,\" O\\'Malley responded. \"Welcome to Iowa,\" said another man. \"We hope to see you here more.\" O\\'Malley smiled, \"Thanks a lot. I hope you do, too.\" Webb wasn\\'t nearly as active, opting instead to stay close to his seat near the front of the venue and chat with a small group of people around him. As Webb cut into his sizable helping of pork, O\\'Malley was standing directly behind him, shaking hands. The former Virginia senator, after possibly seeing O\\'Malley making the rounds, did stand up and shake hands with a few of the diehard Democratic activists in the room. \"Seven months old,\" Zach Smith, a new father, said of his baby boy, Noah. \"I have a bunch of kids. The youngest one is 8 years old,\" Webb said. The baby looked up at the senator. \"He is pretty calm,\" Webb remarked, himself calm. Despite coming from bordering states, Webb and O\\'Malley don\\'t know each other. When they passed each other in a Des Moines hotel lobby on Friday morning, it was the first time the two had met. That said, the two Democrats find themselves in the same position. Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who is set to announce her presidential bid Sunday, leads every national and state poll of the Democratic field. She has begun to build a sizable staff and is expected to have massive amounts of money to win the nomination. O\\'Malley and Webb are both looking up at her. In a March CNN/ORC poll (PDF) of national Democrats, only 1% said O\\'Malley and Webb were their top choice. In a January poll from Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register (PDF), O\\'Malley was at 1% among Iowa Democrats, while Webb found himself at 3%. The speaking portion of the night further showed Webb and O\\'Malley\\'s differences. Webb, who spoke before the governor, gave a more subdued, biographical speech that mentioned three areas he would focus on if he ran for president: Basic governance, economic justice and criminal justice reform. To the approval of the audience, Webb promised to come back to Iowa regularly. \"I am committing to you right now,\" he said, \"we are going to go over the whole state.\" And the biggest applause came near the end of his speech, when he urged his party to get back to talking about issues. \"Money is ruining our political process,\" Webb said to a chorus of applause and \"hear hear.\" O\\'Malley, on the other hand, gave a speech littered with intentional applause lines. At points, the governor would deliberately stop to allow for the silence to be filled with clapping hands. \"When the American Dream is denied, our lives shrink, our hopes fade, and our days unfold not in the light of possibility but in the darkness of fear,\" O\\'Malley said, delivering the same stump speech he usually gives. \"To make the dream true again, we must fight for better wages for all workers, so that Americans can support their families on what they earn.\" As the event wound down, Webb and O\\'Malley stuck around to shake more hands and meet people. O\\'Malley, who spent the previous day in Iowa, left Friday night for New York. Webb, who is in the midst of a four-day trip to Iowa, stayed in Des Moines and headlined a veterans event on Saturday morning in Waterloo. Webb regularly speaks about his service and appeared more at home at the event. He told war stories with young and old veterans and spoke at length about how the government could be doing more for veterans. He also touted his work on passing the 21st Century G.I. Bill of Rights, a 2008 act that expanded education benefits for veterans, and stressed that more needed to be done. \"You want the next greatest generation, give them the same opportunity the the greatest generation had,\" Webb said to applause. \"If you really want to thank them, hire a vet.\" After the event, Webb shook hands with people veterans who told stories about dropped benefits and problems with the Department of Veterans Affairs. He occasionally smiled and thanked people for coming on a sunny Saturday morning. Asked whether he enjoys the retail politics that is crucial in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, Webb smiled. Skepticism of retail politics is not new for Webb. As a one-term Democratic senator, Webb was rumored to loathe the burdens that came with campaigning, namely fundraising and retail politics. This time, he put on a rosy view. \"This is the good part of it, \"Webb said, with a laugh. \"Talking to the media, that is not always the good part.\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)Police officers Saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of Walter Scott to his South Carolina funeral service, where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in America. A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott\\'s relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott\\'s daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. \"The change will come,\" he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, George Hamilton, spoke of how Scott had brought members of his family to the church, of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video. The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was \"motivated by racial prejudice,\" Hamilton said. It was \"an act of overt racism.\" \"Hate came because Walter was an African-American,\" he said. Hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement, but he singled out the officer who killed Scott as a \"disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department.\" \"There is gong to be change,\" he said. \"Walter\\'s death will not be in vain.\" After the service, pallbearers gently lifted Scott\\'s casket into the hearse. Crowds poured from the church. A slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for the private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue. \"It\\'s a human issue,\" he said. \"We\\'re getting emails from people in Arkansas telling us, \\'I\\'m a white male, and I\\'m supporting this family.\\' Their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other.\" On Friday night, Scott\\'s open casket was draped with an American flag, and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in Charleston. A Dallas Cowboys banner -- his favorite NFL team -- was placed outside the casket, and a figurine of a Cowboys player stood at his side. But Scott\\'s family was missing. They needed privacy, said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, who attended. A week ago, Scott was killed in North Charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight. A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder. He was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. Who was Walter Scott? The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots. Scott is struck five times; he falls to the ground. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer\\'s life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" But one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting. And at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up. On Thursday, Gwen Nichols told CNN\\'s Brian Todd that she saw Scott and Slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, \\'What do you want?\\' or \\'What did I do?\\' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn\\'t hear Mr. Slager saying \\'Stop!\\' \" Nichols\\' account has similarities to Slager\\'s. He had told investigators that he had tussled with Scott over his Taser and that he feared for his safety. A timeline of events . Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager\\'s defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. But the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video, Feidin Santana, paints a different picture. He was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, he said, who was on the ground. Santana said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. He said he didn\\'t see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. Investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start, it said in a statement. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" division Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Slager\\'s lawyer, Andy Savage, has complained that he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage\\'s office said in a statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager\\'s arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Slager\\'s wife, Jamie, who is eight months\\' pregnant, and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center Friday.  Slager was being held in isolation and being \"monitored for his mental health,\" Cannon said. In a statement, one of Slager\\'s lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour. \"His wife and mom were tearful but strong, and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person, even if separated by a thick pane of glass,\" the statement said. \"They held up family photos -- and even Jamie\\'s ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him. Throughout the visit, Michael was focused on Jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families.\" A second video, taken from a police dash cam, has also emerged from the day Scott died. It shows moments before  the shooting, when things seemed to be going smoothly between Scott and Slager. Scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Then Scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera\\'s frame. Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That was why he ran, lawyers for the family said after the funeral service. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, told reporters outside the service that Scott lost a $35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support. \"He said it was the best job he\\'s ever had,\" Clyburn said. \"Now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support, there\\'s got to be income. And you ain\\'t going to make much income from jail. It seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom.\" On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott\\'s car, but the passenger\\'s name wasn\\'t in a police report obtained by CNN. He was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the passenger by name. On Friday, a few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home for Funerals. A white banner with a blue star near Scott\\'s casket displayed his favorite NFL team. It said: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" said Riley, the mayor. \"It breaks everyone\\'s hearts.\" CNN\\'s Polo Sandoval and Martin Savidge reported from Charleston, and Ben Brumfield and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote in Atlanta and New York.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)A federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, a convicted felon, with unlawful possession of a firearm. In this week\\'s indictment,  Durst, 71, is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver, which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge, according to the indictment. The charge is the latest in a litany of accusations. A Louisiana judge ruled last month that Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail at a facility near New Orleans. Durst was featured this spring in \"The Jinx,\" a HBO documentary about him. He\\'s accused of killing his friend  Susan Berman at her home in California in 2000. He also faces state weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans. Last month, court documents claimed that Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash. He also had a UPS tracking number. The package was intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said, and it contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. But the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last month. He awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of \"lying in wait\" and killing Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she \"was a witness to a crime.\" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst\\'s first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with Berman\\'s death or his wife\\'s disappearance. It\\'s not the first time he has been accused of murder. He admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst\\'s attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it\\'s a sign that authorities are desperate. DeGuerin has said Durst has serious medical conditions. He is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said. \"At the same time he was in the hospital, he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he\\'s got some serious health issues. ... He\\'s lost a lot of weight. He\\'s not in good health,\" DeGuerin said. DeGuerin also said that Durst is \"mildly autistic\" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country\\'s leading experts in Asperger\\'s syndrome and autism.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Fans of the late actor Paul Walker knew that watching him in \"Furious 7\" would be bittersweet. Even so, many moviegoers said the final scenes of the new film, which earned a record $146 million over the weekend, still packed an emotional wallop. \"Not gonna lie, I shed a few tears at the end of Furious 7. The tribute to Paul Walker was very well done,\" one woman said Monday on Twitter. Hers was just one of a flood of messages on social media from people who said they got choked up during scenes featuring Walker, who died at 40 in a car crash in November 2013, before filming on \"Furious 7\" was completed. To finish Walker\\'s scenes, the makers of the movie used body doubles, computer-generated images and even the actor\\'s brothers. But it was the ending that really got to moviegoers. In finishing \"Furious 7,\" the film\\'s producers sought to retire Walker\\'s character, Brian, while paying homage to his role in the blockbuster \"Furious\" action franchise. But they felt that killing him off might appear exploitative. \"If they had gone down the other path, I think I would have refused to finish making this movie,\" director James Wan told BuzzFeed. Instead, the movie\\'s makers chose to \"retire Paul\\'s character in the most sincere and elegant way (they) could,\" Wan said. Their idea was to have Brian retire from his dangerous, high-octane lifestyle out of a sense of responsibility to his growing family with girlfriend Mia, who is pregnant with their second child. A scene late in the movie shows him and Mia playing on a beach with their son while the crew looks on -- essentially saying goodbye. Then his longtime buddy Dom reminisces about their years together, leading to a montage of Walker scenes from the first six movies. The song that plays over the montage is  \"See You Again,\" a collaboration between Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth. Co-star Vin Diesel shared the video for the song late Sunday on his Facebook page, where it has more than 1.5 million likes. Fans on Twitter and Facebook mostly praised the movie\\'s ending as a fitting tribute -- and an emotionally wrenching one. \"Man I don\\'t care how tough u are or how gangsta u claim to be . ...the last five minutes had me choked up in the movie theater ... I saw it 3 times in one day ... ...the ending is the deepest ending I\\'ve ever seen,\" one man wrote on the movie\\'s Facebook page.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Havana, Cuba (CNN)All eyes are going to be on the new kid finally allowed to play and the big kid who for so long wanted nothing to do with him -- Cuba and the United States in the same diplomatic playground. Cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by marshaling the support of other regional countries to insist on their attendance at the Summit of the Americas. And for the first time since 1962, the U.S. has not blocked Cuba\\'s attempt to join. Now it\\'s time to see how they play and who they play with -- especially Venezuela, which often falls out with Washington for crushing dissent at home and supplying Havana with billions of dollars in oil. Cuba is trying to re-establish itself at the two-day summit in Panama, arriving with more than 100 government officials, diplomats, small business people and artists. But Cuba\\'s attempts to rebrand itself as an open, diverse society stumbled Wednesday when government supporters and anti-Castro supporters brawled in the streets of Panama. Video of the incident showed Cuban government officials exchanging punches and insults with dissidents until Panamanian police in riot gear broke up the melee. With the historic thawing in relations between the U.S. and Cuba, Washington now has urgent business to discuss with Havana. \"We have really big issues with the Cubans that do need to be solved,\" said Ambassador Vicki Huddleston, who served as the chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. She added \"The Cubans are typical of their negotiating style. You think it\\'s going to be easy because we have said \\'We are going to have good relations with you\\' and they say, \\'That\\'s not exciting for us and it is for you.\\' So they are hard negotiators as they always have been.\" The forum could provide the opportunity to push forward an agreement to re-establish formal relations and re-open embassies after nearly four months of negotiations. While President Barack Obama is not scheduled to meet Cuban leader Raul Castro, U.S. officials said there will be opportunities for \"interaction\" between the two leaders. The first time the two heads of state met was in 2013 at Nelson Mandela\\'s funeral. Their brief handshake captured the world\\'s attention and lit up social media. Few people then knew that the two countries were secretly involved in negotiations to thaw five decades of deadlocked Cold War-era relations. Obama had said he had hoped a U.S. Embassy would reopen in Havana before the summit, but Cuban officials have said they cannot imagine a full restoration of diplomatic ties until Cuba is removed from the U.S. State Department list of countries that support terrorism. \"It would be difficult to explain that diplomatic relations have been resumed while Cuba has been unjustly listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism,\" said Josefina Vidal, the general director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry and lead negotiator in the talks. Cuba was added to the list in 1982, which includes Syria, Iran and Sudan. The designation carries financial sanctions which Cuban officials say further damages their already ailing economy. The State Department has sent a recommendation to the White House that Cuba be removed, paving the way for the White House to announce its intent to de-list Cuba as early as this week, two administration officials told CNN. Removal from the list \"does not relate to whether or not we agree with everything a country does or whether we agree with its political system, or its foreign policy,\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. \"It\\'s a very practical review as to whether or not a government is sponsoring terrorism.\" Rhodes also dialed backed rhetoric on Venezuela, saying the country did not pose a national security threat to the United States, despite a recent declaration to that effect. The designation was meant to allow officials to target seven allegedly corrupt Venezuelan officials, but it ignited a firestorm, particularly in Cuba, which has close ties to Venezuela. Deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was a friend and admirer of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Chavez\\'s successor Nicolas Maduro continues to send Cuba tens of thousands of barrels of oil each day, despite his country\\'s own economic turmoil. In exchange, Cuba sends doctors, military advisers and sports trainers to Venezuela. In Cuba\\'s state-run media, criticism of U.S. policy towards Venezuela has overshadowed the improvement in U.S.-Cuba relations. In March, Fidel Castro published a letter criticizing the U.S.\\' \"brutal plans towards\" Venezuela and the Cuban government promised \"unconditional aid\" to help defend against American threats. Its remains to be seen how much Cuba will risk its warming relations with the United States to back up ally Venezuela. But apparently there is little doubt among the Cuban people on what their government should do. A poll of 1,200 Cubans released on Wednesday found that 97% of the people surveyed by Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision Noticias/Fusion supported improved U.S.-Cuban relations.',\n",

Sam Brownback on Tuesday, bans what it describes as \"dismemberment abortion\" and defines as \"knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus.\" Supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step, while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur, but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy. The law allows for the procedure if \"necessary to protect the life or health of the mother,\" according to a statement on Brownback\\'s website. On Twitter, Brownback, a Republican, said he was proud to sign a law \"protecting life at its most vulnerable stage.\" Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move, which it described as the latest in a series of \"extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability.\" \"Kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the U.S.,\" the advocacy group said in a Facebook post. Both sides appear to be prepared to take their battle over such measures to other states -- and to court. Carol Tobias, the president of National Right to Life, said in a statement that the Kansas law was the first of what her organization hopes \"will be many state laws.\" \"This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States,\" she said. Julie Burkhart,  CEO of Wichita-based South Wind Women\\'s Center, said on Twitter that the signing of the law marked a sad day for Kansas and the United States. \"This law puts women at risk and ties doctors\\' hands,\" she said. \"We\\'ll continue to fight!\" CNN\\'s Sam Stringer contributed to this report.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Jodi Arias was sentenced to life in prison Monday for the gruesome 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander. Maricopa County Judge Sherry Stephens could have sentenced Arias to life with the possibility of early release after 25 years, but decided the convicted killer should spend the rest of her life behind bars. Before her sentence was handed down, Arias expressed remorse for her actions. \"To this day I can\\'t believe that I was capable of doing something that terrible,\" Arias said. \"I\\'m truly disgusted and repulsed with myself. I\\'m horrified because of what I did, and I wish there was some way I could take it back.\" Earlier, Travis Alexander\\'s sisters gave their victim impact statements. Hillary Alexander said she\\'s trying to block her brother from her life. \"I don\\'t want to remember him anymore, because it hurts too much to remember him alive. ... I remember how he was brutally taken from us and I can\\'t handle it. This is what I\\'ve had to do so I can cope,\" she said through tears. Arias, 34, was found guilty of first-degree murder in May 2013. The jury that convicted her found the murder was especially cruel, making Arias eligible for the death penalty. However, that same jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on whether she should live or die. A new jury was empanelled in October 2014 to decide Arias\\' fate, but they, too, were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Because a second jury was deadlocked in the penalty phase of Arias\\' case, the death penalty was taken off the table, leaving Arias\\' sentence up to the judge. Arias will serve her sentence at the Lumley Unit in the Arizona State Prison Complex-Perryville near Goodyear, Arizona.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Hillary Clinton finally answered the question we\\'ve all been asking for years: Will she run for president in 2016? With official news of her candidacy just hours old, one thing is already crystal clear: For the next year and a half, Clinton will be the barometer by which we assess gender equality in the United States. Win or lose, this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder. Just consider the two potential outcomes. A win would mean a woman in the White House, which is a vital step in the march toward women\\'s full political inclusion. But it\\'s possible that the march will end right there. We\\'ll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we\\'ve come. We\\'ll raise the \"Mission Accomplished\" banner over the women\\'s movement. And we\\'ll call it a day. Granted, 80% of elected officials throughout the country will still be men. Women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office. And pay inequities, sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve, no matter how hard Clinton might try. \"But we\\'ve elected a woman as president,\" we\\'ll say. Let her take care of it. A loss would be even more difficult. Clinton will be blamed for running a subpar campaign regardless of how brilliant her strategy is. More generally, her loss would perpetuate the myth that women cannot win big elections, that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination, and that women must be twice as good to get half as far. \"If Hillary Clinton can\\'t win an election,\" potential female candidates will ask, \"How can I?\" Extrapolating from one female candidate\\'s experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect. But in the case of Clinton, it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons. First, Clinton is no ordinary female presidential candidate, if there is such a thing. She began the 2008 race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve, and she is even more well-known today. But that means that she also enters the electoral arena with 23 years of public accomplishments and 23 years of well-publicized baggage. Voters, donors, journalists and pundits all hold clear impressions of Clinton before she ever eats a corn dog in Iowa, steps onto a debate stage in New Hampshire or takes a shot of bourbon in Kentucky. Too often, we treat Clinton\\'s loss to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power. In reality, what people knew about Hillary Clinton likely shaped their views of Hillary Clinton. Widespread sexism and misogyny likely did not. After all, for decades, women who have run for office have performed just as well as men. They win elections at equal rates and routinely raise comparable amounts of money. Do some voters still question women\\'s suitability as leaders? Of course they do. But these attitudes, which have become increasingly rare, do not translate into systematic biases against female candidates. Second, presidential politics is, first and foremost, a partisan affair. The D or R in front of the candidates\\' names -- not the X or Y chromosomes in their DNA -- tells us about how more than 90% of the population will vote. Party polarization has essentially rendered the importance of sex on the campaign trail far less relevant than might otherwise be the case. Now, I\\'ll be the first to predict that by the middle of the week, we will be able to assemble a reel of sexist comments uttered by pundits, and we will be one mouse click away from a steady stream of misogynistic memes, photos and captions that have taken hold on social media. The Clinton campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address, which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes. I don\\'t want to diminish the problems associated with this type of behavior or the fact that it is inappropriate, disrespectful and appalling. And incorporating these concerns into a broad campaign strategy is likely something that male candidates won\\'t need to consider. But men yelling \"Iron my shirt\" at a campaign rally, cable news pundits associating Clinton with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing Hillary Clinton nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections, partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know. If Clinton wins the race, it will be because it was a good year for Democrats. And if she loses, it will be because the GOP developed a winning message. But how much does any of this really matter? Sure, voters are amenable to electing women. Any Democratic nominee would face the same electoral landscape. The problems confronting women in society are just as grave regardless of who occupies the White House. And inferring too much from Hillary Clinton\\'s experiences is a risky endeavor. Yet the minute Clinton announced her candidacy, she became the official litmus test for true gender equality in the United States. That\\'s a label that no female candidate should have to wear. Let the burden begin.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will need to keep his lawyers even after being convicted of murder and other charges in the death of Odin Lloyd. The 25-year-old potentially faces three more trials -- one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW.  Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The trial was originally slated for May 28, but Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney\\'s Office, said Wednesday the trial had been postponed and no new date had been set. \"We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track. The Suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the July 16, 2012, shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston\\'s South End; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm,\" he said. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims the then-New England Patriot tight end wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed four months later, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally \"possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have.\" Hernandez\\'s lawyers have argued he couldn\\'t defend himself properly while on trial in Massachusetts. There was no criminal charge in the case. And then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the NFL players union on behalf of Hernandez, who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $40 million. If the grievance is heard by the league, Hernandez will be represented by the the National Football League Players\\' Association. Who was Odin Lloyd?

The sisters were born in the Somali capital but were forced to flee after war broke out in 1991. Along with their parents, the girls relocated to Canada as refugees where during their teens they discovered a passion for music. Heading south to LA by way of Atlanta, the singing sisters with a bold flair for fashion are now embarking on a musical journey, gearing up to unleash their Afro-pop sound to the world. CNN\\'s African Voices caught up with the sister act -- known collectively as Faarrow (combining the translation of their names into English -- Iman means \"Faith\" and Siham means \"Arrow\") to talk about music, aspirations and Somalia. CNN: Hi guys, thanks for chatting with me today. What are some of your musical influences? Iman: We love Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie -- stuff my mom would listen to and play -- and the Spice Girls. We used to die for the Spice Girls. I love new artists now but I don\\'t know if it\\'s a nostalgia, but I remember ... my mom used to pump whatever -- Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston. CNN: You are working on your debut album now -- how\\'s that been? Siham: We\\'ve been working with Elijah Kelley -- he\\'s actually an actor. He was in \"Hairspray,\" \"The Butler,\" and most recently he was in the George Lucas animation, \"Strange Magic.\" That\\'s what he\\'s more known for but his first passion is music. He\\'s an incredible producer, writer and singer. I just felt like he was always the missing piece. He brought everything together. CNN: So now that you\\'ve found your \"missing piece,\" how would you describe your sound? Siham: Our music before was experimenting with Afrobeat sounds but now it\\'s more of a fusion (of what) we are inspired by. It\\'s pop with undertones of hip hop and rhythmic African percussion. It\\'s a fusion of everything. CNN: And do you guys write the songs as well? Siham: The entire album was pretty much (written and produced) by me, my sister and Elijah. And when we signed we already had a lot of those songs already done. Warner Brothers Records is really great in that way that they already loved what we were doing and let us do our own thing. CNN: What are you listening to right now? Siham: Oh my God, there\\'s so many! Iman: Sia with \"Chandelier.\" Siham: I really love this new song -- I don\\'t know if Iman is going to agree with me -- but his name\\'s LunchMoney Lewis, it\\'s called Bills; I love it. CNN: As well as your music, you both work with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) -- how did you start your humanitarian work? Iman: Ever since we were kids we wanted to help Somalia, we always talked about it. But we were like \"what can we physically do?\" We were doing some research and we called our mom and she said \\'You know you still have family over there. There\\'s a refugee camp in Kenya and your great uncle and his kids live in a refugee camp.\\' And we did some research about Dadaab refugee camp, it\\'s a massive camp that has taken in Sudanese refugees, Somali refugees, Rwandan refugees -- pretty much anywhere there was a conflict. Everybody fled to Dadaab. In the beginning (it was) pure advocacy talking about it on Twitter and Facebook. CNN: But then you decided to \"up your game\" as it were... Iman: Yes, then we started a non-profit and we\\'d do small benefit concerts in Toronto and in San Diego -- wherever there was a big Somali community we would do outreach but all we had was our singing, working with UNHCR in a capacity as a spokesperson. We headlined World Refugee Day at the Kennedy Center, as well as the Nansen Awards twice in Geneva. We felt like this platform of singing -- the bigger it gets, the more we can do. Siham: We obviously love fashion so we wanted to do our own socially conscious brand so we\\'ve been making these bracelets and necklaces called \"Wish Creatively.\" Wish stands for \"Women Internationally Selling Hope.\" We wanted to do a socially conscious brand where we sell these bracelets where it goes back to projects in Kenya or Somalia with women providing them with a sustainable income. CNN: So what\\'s next for you two? Siham: We\\'re actually in the mixing process right now. We still have a few (tracks) to finish up but the majority of the album is pretty much done. We want to turn it in as soon as possible so they can put together a rollout plan and get ready for the first single to drop. Iman: I don\\'t feel like we ever lost that feeling like we\\'re creative spokespersons for our generation as well as for Somalia. I feel like now because we followed our dreams it\\'s like \\'they\\'re not just refugees anymore.\\' We don\\'t have to become doctors so we can one day give back to Somalia and help rebuild -- it\\'s such a beautiful dream but not ours. In our culture, anything creative is not really respected or appreciated. But I feel like now but even with our new deal we\\'re still trucking along. I feel like we inspire people.

But she\\'s now bringing awareness to the difficulties of life on food stamps. In a tweet Friday, Paltrow showcased an array of leafy greens, dried beans and rice, purchased for the amount a person living on food stamps is allotted each week, she explained. The amount of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits a person can get is based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s Thrifty Food Plan. The plan estimates how much it costs to buy food, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. In this case, Paltrow will be spending just under $30 for groceries. Her participation is part of the #FoodBankNYCChallenge. Celebrity chef Mario Batali, a close friend of the star\\'s, nominated Paltrow and musicians Sting and Deborah Harry for the challenge through a video. The challenge urges participants to use only $29 for all the food a person eats for seven days. \"For one week, walk in someone else\\'s shoes,\" Batali is quoted saying on the Food Bank for New York City\\'s website. \"By truly understanding what our friends and neighbors are going through, we will be better equipped to find solutions.\" The #FoodBankNYCChallenge is an attempt to live on a food stamp budget for one week, which translates to $1.38 per meal, according to the site. The effort is in response to recent cuts to food stamps. \"Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,\" the site explains. Organizers hope the challenge will raise public awareness of the struggles for families to afford food while on food stamps.',\n",

In a statement Tuesday, the guard/forward for the Atlanta Hawks described his injury as \"significant,\" and said it \"was caused by the police.\" Sefolosha suffered a fractured fibula and ligament damage when he and teammate Pero Antic were arrested near the scene of the stabbing of Indiana Pacers forward Chris Copeland and two other women early April 8. Police said Sefolosha and Antic were not involved in the stabbing incident, but they were charged with misdemeanors, including disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration. TMZ Sports released video last week that shows a group of police officers arresting the 6-foot-7 Sefolosha and taking him to the ground. It also shows an officer within that group getting out a baton and extending it near him, but what may have caused the injury is not clear in the video. Sefolosha appears to be limping as he is led away by officers. New York Police Department Sgt. Daniel Doody said Wednesday that the matter is being reviewed by the Internal Affairs Bureau and would not comment further. Internal Affairs had no comment. Sefolosha did not specify his injury in his statement Tuesday, but the Hawks said last week that he has a fractured fibula and ligament damage, will undergo surgery and will miss the rest of the season, including the playoffs, which begin this weekend. The Hawks enter as the top seed in the NBA\\'s Eastern Conference. Sefolosha, who turns 31 in May, is in his ninth NBA season and his first with the Hawks. He averaged 5.3 points per game this season. \"I am extremely disappointed that I will not be able to join my teammates on the court during the playoffs and apologize to them for any distraction this incident has caused,\" Sefolosha said in his statement. \"I will be cheering for them every step of the way and will be diligent in my rehabilitation. \"On advice of counsel, I hope you can appreciate that I cannot discuss the facts of the case. Those questions will be answered by my attorney in a court of law. I will simply say that I am in great pain, have experienced a significant injury and that the injury was caused by the police.\" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said in a statement last week, \"This is a very difficult situation for Thabo and our thoughts and support will be with him during his recovery. We know that his approach and dedication will serve him well in his rehabilitation. Our team remains focused and will be prepared as we head into the postseason.\" Antic, a 31-year-old, 6-foot-11 center/forward, missed the April 8 game against the Brooklyn Nets, but has played since then. In a joint statement last week, Sefolosha and Antic said they will contest the charges. According to the Pacers, Copeland underwent surgery on his abdomen and left elbow for stab wounds. He was released from the hospital two days after the incident, according to Bleacher Report. The Pacers, with one regular-season game left, are trying to secure the last spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs. If they do, their first-round opponent would be Atlanta.

It has been 42 days since the last known case of B3 strain of measles, the equivalent of two successive incubation periods, said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the health department. The department said in its latest update that 131 people came down with the B3 strain, and five who had a different genotype than the outbreak strain. Of the 131 cases, the state was able to obtain the vaccination status for 81 patients. Of the 81, 70% were unvaccinated. \"Prompt investigation of cases, interviewing hundreds of contacts of infected people, vaccinating hundreds of at risk people, and increasing awareness among health care providers about measles, helped to control this outbreak,\" Smith said. The outbreak began with dozens of visitors to two Disney theme parks in the state. The health department said 42 of the cases occurred from December 17-20. Two patients with rashes have been identified in April, but they have a different measles genotype. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that 19 different strains have been discovered since 1990. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can cause deadly health complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis.

Stancil is accused of killing an employee Monday at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina.

Authorities arrested Stancil after he was found sleeping on a Florida beach on Tuesday. Just a few minutes into Thursday\\'s hearing on the first-degree murder charge he faces, Stancil snapped back at the judge after he was offered a court-appointed lawyer. \"No, I don\\'t need one,\" said Stancil, who stood before the judge with his legs shackled and his arms handcuffed in front of him. \"You know what I\\'m saying? I knew I would get life anyway.\" Superior Court Judge Arnold O. Jones interjected, pointing out that the maximum sentence Stancil faces is the death penalty. \"Yes, I know that,\" Stancil fired back. \"But when I knew what I had to do and I knew when I got caught, you know, I knew in my mind that I could get life, I could get the death penalty. You know what I\\'m saying? Do you follow my topic? I would have killed you, you know what I\\'m saying, if you\\'re a f---ing child molester.\" The judge told him not to swear. \"I don\\'t give a f--- what you want,\" Stancil said, lunging forward and lifting up the table in front of him. Deputies quickly corralled him and hustled him from the courtroom. The hearing resumed about 25 minutes later, when Stancil was brought back into the courtroom, this time with his arms handcuffed behind him. When asked again by Jones whether he wanted a lawyer, his response was quick -- and calm. \"Yes, sir,\" he said. In an interview with CNN affiliate WRAL, Stancil described himself as a neo-Nazi and said he hates gay people \"with a passion.\" Stancil had worked for Lane, the school\\'s print shop operator, as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March because of poor attendance, college officials said. During the interview, and during a court appearance in Florida on Tuesday, Stancil said Lane deserved to die, accusing him of being a child molester who\\'d made advances in online messages to Stancil\\'s 16-year-old brother. Lane\\'s family has described those accusations as untrue and slanderous. His cousin, Steve Smith, told WRAL that Lane never made sexual advances toward children or anyone with whom he worked.

The documents show Bates had one Taser training class over a six-and-a-half-year period, took three firearms training classes and qualified 10 times, from 2009 to 2014, to use a handgun. His evaluations say he got along with other officers and related well with the public. \"Robert Bates has met all the requisite training required by Oklahoma to be a reserve deputy,\" said the lawyer, Scott Wood, in an interview with CNN. Read the documents . CNN could not independently confirm the documents were authentic. Wood said he got them from Bates, who asked the Tulsa County Sheriff\\'s Office to provide his training records. The sheriff\\'s office has turned down CNN\\'s requests for the training documents, saying they are part of the investigation. Authorities did not reply Saturday to a request for comment on Wood\\'s statements. The documents are important because Bates\\' training has become a central issue in the case. The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates, 73, wasn\\'t qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he\\'d made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff\\'s Office were told to forge Bates\\' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Tulsa County Sheriff\\'s Office has denied these allegations. The documents provided to CNN cover the period from July 22, 2008, to December 12, 2014. Bates had one Taser training class, on March 4, 2009, according to a document with a heading from The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, which sets the standards for training peace officers in the state. Wood said the council requires only one hands-on class on use of a Taser. Bates had weapons training once in September 2008 and twice in 2009, according to sheriff\\'s office records that Bates obtained, Wood said. He scored high enough at the pistol range 10 times from September 24, 2009, to April 9, 2014, that he was allowed to carry a handgun while on duty, Wood said. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Eric Harris. Friends and family of Harris gathered in Tulsa on Saturday afternoon for a visitation and viewing. Bates is free on $25,000 bond. He says he meant to use his Taser on Harris during the April 2 arrest but accidentally fired his handgun instead. \"I shot him! I\\'m sorry!\" Bates is heard saying on video of the incident. Bates, an insurance company executive, has gone to his own defense. In an interview Friday with the \"Today\" show on NBC, Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies. \"That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing,\" he told the show. Questions have already been raised about Bates\\' training and when his service with the Tulsa County Sheriff\\'s Office started. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he \"became an advanced TCSO Reserve Deputy in 2007.\" Wood said Bates started working for the sheriff\\'s office in late 2007 or 2008. But the sheriff\\'s office has said Bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008. Bates, who worked as a police officer for one year in the 1960s, completed 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience since becoming a reserve deputy, according to the sheriff\\'s office. The Tulsa World said 480 hours of field training are required to be an \"advanced\" reserve deputy, which Bates claimed to be. Questions have been raised about Bates\\' firearms qualifications scores. To be allowed to carry a pistol on duty, deputies need to score 72 while firing at a silhouette of a man at the firing range, Wood said. Documents with a heading \"Firearms Qualification Record\" show Bates scoring at least 72 on six different days. But firearms qualification records from four dates in 2012 and 2013 are missing for the entire sheriff\\'s office, Wood said. The Tulsa County Sheriff\\'s Office says it can\\'t find the records. The department\\'s summary of Bates\\' weapons training shows he scored 80-84 those four times. \"If you\\'re going to forge somebody\\'s score why not give them a 90 or a 95,\" Wood said. CNN provided the documents to the Tulsa World. Ziva Branstetter, an editor with the newspaper, said the new information doesn\\'t undercut the World\\'s reporting. \"These records back up the validity of our story and we stand by our story,\" she said Saturday. Another seeming oddity of the records is how many classes Bates took on two days. The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training records show Bates took 14 training classes worth 20 credit hours on December 10, 2013, and 20 classes worth 31 credit hours on December 11, 2014. Wood said Bates may have been cramming in his required training before the end of the year by taking computer classes. \"It\\'s possible you could take a half-hour class and if you know the material you could finish it in 15 minutes,\" he said. Evaluations show supervisors had a good opinion of Bates. One from March 14, 2009, says of his strengths: \"Works well with his fellow officers and relates to the public very well.\" His weakness: \"Radio usage/geography.\" Remedial training: \"Does not have a lot of radio usage time which will be worked on. Will have to work on his geography skills. Both will be remedied in time!\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Los Angeles (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion \"Suge\" Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic \"Straight Outta Compton\" earlier this year. In addition to that ruling, Judge Ronald Coen also lowered Knight\\'s bail to $10 million from $25 million, a figure that defense lawyers called excessive. The judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against Knight. In all, Knight will stand trial on one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run, the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended Thursday. Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted. Knight suffers diabetes and blot clots, and the case has clearly strained him: He collapsed in court last month after learning of the $25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment. Knight was in court Thursday. At the end of hearing, he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery, and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom. In a press conference after the hearing, fiancee Toi Kelly said regarding Knight\\'s health that he is \"doing much better.\" The judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because California law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon, in this case the vehicle Knight was driving, is used against several people. Knight is accused of running over two men, killing one of them, during an argument. Killed was Terry Carter, 55. The survivor is Cle Sloan, 51, who in testimony this week declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan doesn\\'t want to be a \"snitch\" who sends Knight to prison, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity, but he still refused to testify against Knight on Monday, the affiliates reported. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic \"Straight Outta Compton,\" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam\\'s Burgers in Compton. At the time, Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case. The hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows Knight inside a red truck. In the video, the truck pulls into the entrance of the Compton restaurant, and he is then approached by Sloan, who was working security on the site. The two men appear to talk for a few moments, with Knight still in his vehicle. Suddenly, the vehicle backs up, knocking Sloan to the ground. While still in reverse, the truck moves out of range of the security camera. The vehicle is then seen zooming forward, back into camera range, running over Sloan a second time, and then running over a second man, Carter, a former rap music label owner. Carter later died. In closing arguments prior to the judge\\'s ruling, Knight\\'s attorney Matthew Fletcher argued that Knight was the victim. Knight was only defending himself against Sloan, whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time. \"Mr. Sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor,\" Knight\\'s attorney argued. \"There\\'s no intent to kill, there\\'s an intent to survive.\" \"Even without a gun, we know Mr. Sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight,\" the defense attorney said. Fletcher added that Knight\\'s defense was to stand his ground. Sloan \"needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor,\" Fletcher said. \"He is the person who got Terry (Carter) killed.\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes argued, however, told the judge that Knight was engaged in \"mutual combat situation\" where he used his car as deadly weapon. If Knight \"ever had the right of self-defense, the moment he backed-up and Mr. Sloan was ran-over, he lost the right of self-defense,\" Barnes said. \"There was pre-mediation and intent when he (Knight) ran over him a second time.\" Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (now known as Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur\\'s death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label\\'s bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Two Delaware boys are in a coma and their father still is unable to talk or move two weeks after they became sick -- perhaps from pesticide exposure, federal officials say -- during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands, their lawyer said Saturday. Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens\\' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family was airlifted to hospitals in the United States. The boys, 16 and 14, were in critical condition at a Philadelphia hospital on Saturday, the family\\'s lawyer, James Maron of Delaware, said. \"The boys are in rough shape,\" Maron said. \"The family are all fighters,\" he added. \"They\\'re fighting for everything right now. I understand it\\'s a long recovery.\" Esmond, also being treated at a hospital, is conscious but cannot move, Maron said. The teens\\' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital but released, and is now in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family began had been renting since March 14. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency\\'s preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It\\'s not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. \"It\\'s an ongoing investigation; we\\'re still on the island doing our assessment,\" Rodriguez said. \"We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling.\" Final test results were expected next week. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Maron, the family\\'s attorney, declined to comment on the investigation. Depending on the season, the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but their unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. \"Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services,\" the company said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings, the parent company of Terminix. In an email to CNN, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" \"We\\'re thinking about the family, and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery,\" Terminix wrote. The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as \"serious.\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)A freshly fallen tree in the roadway was Jason Warnock\\'s first clue. Warnock was driving through a canyon in Lewiston, Idaho, on Wednesday when he saw the tree, then looked up to see an SUV dangling over the edge of a cliff. The only thing holding the GMC Yukon and its terrified driver from a 30-foot drop was a crumpled chain-link fence, still clinging to the earth above Bryden Canyon Road. \"I seen that guy hanging there and he was trying to beat the window out or the door open and I was like \\'Oh man,\\' \\'cause only like five links were hanging there,\" Warnock told KXLY, a CNN affiliate. \"I was like, I gotta do something and no one was doing anything.\" What Warnock did next, captured in a dramatic photo by Lewiston Tribune photographer Barry Kough, made headlines around the world. Warnock dashed from his car and scrambled up a hill to the Yukon and its driver, 23-year-old Matthew Sitko, who appeared to be in shock. \"I got up there and I was like, \\'Are you alright man?\\' He shook his head, yeah. I grabbed my Snap-on multi-tool and it had jagged edges on each end. I hit the window three times and it didn\\'t break. Every time I hit it, the thing rocked like it was going to fall off,\" Warnock told KXLY. Sitko was finally able to get the passenger-side window down. Warnock then reached in and pulled Sitko out to safety -- a moment recorded by Kough\\'s camera. Then Warnock disappeared. \"I left and got out of there before anyone knew who I was,\" he said. He remained an unknown good Samaritan, his identity a mystery, until Kough\\'s picture of the daring rescue appeared in the Lewiston paper and spread across the Internet. \"I don\\'t feel like I deserve any credit or anything,\" Warnock said. \"I just did what anyone would do, went right back to work.\" Thanks to Warnock, Sitko went to the hospital with just minor injuries. \"The Lewiston Police Department would like to thank Jason Warnock for his quick and decisive actions in helping Mr. Sitko and preventing the situation from worsening,\" said Roger Lanier, the interim police chief. Warnock told KXLY he didn\\'t want or expect all the attention and would rather be fishing in the mountains than reading about himself.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Duhok, Iraqi Kurdistan (CNN)The children laugh and shriek, as some of them seem to always have the capacity to do no matter how depressing the circumstances. Their bright clothes provide splashes of color against the otherwise drab monotone white of the endless rows of tents. A small group plays with rocks, replacements for the toys they left behind when they fled, while others clamber through a jagged tear in the wire fence surrounding the refugee camp. The Shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago, made up of some 4,000 tents and counting. Thousands of Yazidis now call this corner of Iraqi Kurdistan home, about 18 miles (30 kilometers) from one of the front lines with ISIS, where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes. The vast majority of the camp\\'s occupants are from the town of Sinjar, which is near the border with Syrian Kurdistan, and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. The fighters separated the young women and girls, some as young as 8 years old, to be sold as slaves, for their \"masters\" to use as concubines. Men faced a choice: Convert to Islam or be shot. Mahmoud was out running errands when ISIS fighters arrived, taking his wife, Ahlam, their three children -- the youngest of which was just a month old -- and his elderly parents. \"They took our phones, jewelry, money,\" Ahlam recalls. \"They had guns. They forced us at gunpoint into big trailer trucks.\" They were taken to a school turned prison in Tal Afar. From there, the family was moved from village to village -- and at one stage taken to Mosul. \"They wrote everyone\\'s name down and they asked where we want to work, in the fields, as cleaners or as herders,\" she says. Ahlam and her family chose to herd goats. They were then taken to a Shia village whose residents had fled, where they were part of a group of around 40 living in one house. In the home, Ahlam found a cell phone left behind by its former occupants and called her husband. \"I said we are alive but we are prisoners.\" Ahlam\\'s husband, who up until that moment had lost the will to live, thinking his family was dead, says he cried out of happiness despite his pain. Ahlam would call when she could, briefly, after midnight, hiding under her bedcovers. If she was caught with a phone, she would be killed. The village itself was a massive prison, its entrances guarded by ISIS fighters. She recalls that two men, in their late 40s or 50s, tried to escape. When they were caught, their bones were broken, their bodies tied to the back of a truck and then driven through the streets. The Yazidi captives were forced to watch the gruesome spectacle. The men\\'s corpses were then tossed into a ditch and an order given not to bury them. One night, some of the Yazidi men risked their lives to toss dirt onto the bodies, to give those slain what dignity they could. Ahlam tells us that about a week before we met, ISIS fighters came by and took away her in-laws and the other elderly people living in the house. \"We didn\\'t know where they were taking them, we thought we would be next,\" she remembers. So she and the rest of the group realized that they had to try to flee. \"We decided that either we survive or we don\\'t.\" They left at midnight. Ahlam cradled the baby, as her two other children, ages 3 and 4 years old, clutched at her clothes. She prayed the baby wouldn\\'t cry, that the children could keep walking. They knew the general direction to take, but not the exact route, and they could only hope it was toward freedom. \"When the sun started to come up, I thought that\\'s it, we are going to get caught,\" Ahlam says. \"And what am I going to do with the kids?  I can\\'t carry all three of them and run.\" Luckily, Ahlam never had to answer that impossible question. The group made it into Iraqi Kurdistan. The couple can\\'t put into words their emotions when they were reunited. Mahmoud, gently caressing his daughter\\'s palm, says he could hardly believe that the woman whose stunning eyes and gentle words he had fallen in love with, and their three children, were by his side again. It had been eight agonizing months. But their joy was tainted by fear for Mahmoud\\'s parents. A few days after Mahmoud and Ahlam were reunited, ISIS released 217 captives. No one is disclosing exactly why. Among them were 60 children, a handful of men and women, and the rest were elderly -- including Mahmoud\\'s parents. \"We didn\\'t know if they were going to slaughter us or what they were going to do with us,\" Mahmoud\\'s father says. \"They moved us around a lot, and at one stage we stayed in in one place for three days.\" But Ahlam\\'s parents are still with ISIS. Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq\\'s parliament, speculates that the Yazidis ISIS released are individuals they were struggling to care for. Dakhil is part of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi\\'s delegation to the United States this week. She will be addressing the United Nations -- pleading for more international support for Iraq and more airstrikes to help defeat ISIS -- and she will address the plight of the Yazidis. \"We sometimes say that we wish we had been massacred. This would be better than being kidnapped and raped. We prefer death now over the fate of what is happening to these girls and women,\" Dakhil says. \"It is now on the government and on the international community to focus on this. How to get these captives back. It\\'s inconceivable that in the 21st century, something like this is happening as if we were living in the Stone Age.\" Ahlam says she was spared because she was breastfeeding and she had young children, which, we\\'re told, makes her impure and therefore unable to be used as a sex slave. For Ahlam, what she went through was not the hardest part of her ordeal. It\\'s the moment when the ISIS fighters began taking away the girls and young women. She\\'s haunted by their screams, the image of them being dragged away sobbing and screaming.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'London (CNN)Ever written yourself a note, stuffed it in your pocket and headed out into the world only to discover that, somewhere along your journey, the piece of paper has disappeared? If you live in the UK, there\\'s a small chance that note has found its way into the hands of 23-year-old Daisy Bentley. For the past six years, the London-based artist has scoured the streets of cities and towns looking for those odd bits of paper that flutter to the ground when their owners aren\\'t looking. Her quest has uncovered a fascinating, if idiosyncratic, collection of shopping lists, reminders, requests, love notes and motivational musings, all poignant pieces of others\\' lives. And now a gallery in London has put a selection on display for the public. \"I wasn\\'t intending to start a collection,\" she told CNN. \"I always naturally collected things -- as many artists do -- and it got to the point that I was picking up every one I saw. Now I can barely walk down a street without picking up a scrap of paper.\" Bentley began collecting them six years ago after a note caught her eye one rainy night on a walk in her home town of Norwich, England. It\\'s something she confesses has been a lifelong love -- keepsakes ranging from her mother\\'s cutlery to her own dead goldfish have ended up carefully preserved in her collection for posterity. The notes project, she says, is a culmination of keeping her eyes on the sidewalk and spotting the little things that most people wouldn\\'t notice as they walked down the street. \"I get very odd looks from strangers,\" she admits, \"but since I\\'ve made friends and families aware of the project, they get very excited when I find one while out with them.\" And while some dismiss such behavior as hoarding, Bentley feels it is part of human nature to hold on to items, no matter how small or insignificant they may seem. \"Humans want to collect and show to others,\" she says. \"They want to share and learn from the things they have found.\" She says her collecting has led to interesting anthropological insights into the human condition. One of her favorite observations is the evolution of handwriting over the past few decades, from the beautiful copperplate penmanship of the \\'70s to modern teen girl love notes with hearts dotting i\\'s and multiple exclamation marks. More recently, the note collection has led to an exhibition at Stour Space gallery in London\\'s Hackney Wick, where Bentley works as a shop and studio manager. It showcases a small part of her 1,500-strong collection. The decision to display the notes came in part from a desire to put them back into the public space. \"I always wanted to showcase them, to see what people\\'s reactions were and if anyone would come forward,\" she said. So far two note owners -- one a colleague from the gallery and one an employee from a pub whose beer coasters she had found on her quest -- have revealed themselves as owners of notes. Bentley gave them framed prints as a thank you. And while some may find the notion of handwritten notes quaint, as social media and smartphones begin to replace handwriting, Bentley says she finds the note collection an interesting way for an artist to explore people\\'s lives. \"Technology is useful, but sometimes the simplest ways are still the best,\" she said. \"I still usually draw a map rather than relying on technology to get to a place -- and many people are just the same.\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Five years after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation\\'s history, we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions. The immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented, with declines in tourism and the seafood industry, as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region. Since then, the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery. In fact, reports indicate that the Gulf of Mexico\\'s seafood industry, which supplies the United States with roughly 40% of its seafood, is finally starting to rebound. However, profound challenges remain, in part because so many questions about the long-term consequences remain unanswered. To this day, it\\'s still unclear where all of the oil went, exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating. One of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the Gulf crab. Crabs play an important role in the region: Roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the Gulf in 2012, earning tens of millions in revenue. Yet in the aftermath of the spill, changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye. Researchers documented substantial differences in appearance, and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints, forcing limbs to fall off. These traits have affected not only the crabs\\' market value but also likely their ability to survive. While these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short-term, the health of these crabs could still be precarious. I have been working with colleagues at Florida International University and University of Louisiana at Lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill. Using the power of genomics and computational biology, we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the Macondo Prospect where the Deepwater Horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab. By studying gene expression, the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell, we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and, based on the types of changes we might see, clues as to how the crabs respond. Although we are still in the early stages of our research, we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant. We are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce. It\\'s not just Gulf crabs that are experiencing changes. Research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long-term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill. This not only has consequences for the Gulf area, where oil drilling continues, but also for communities along the Atlantic Coast, where the Obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration. (BP\\'s vice president of communications, Geoff Morrell, told CNN that wildlife species in the Gulf have \"bounced back and \"there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species.\") With the virtual certainty of more spills, we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently. The U.S. Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency are making some progress. In coming months, they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon spill. But government agencies cannot just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis. Instead, the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing, long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what \"normal\" looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill. Only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been caught on camera guzzling a glass of beer in seven seconds amid raucous cheers from onlookers. His feat of swift consumption in a crowded bar impressed some people but annoyed others. And observers were quick to point out that Abbott had previously criticized binge drinking in Australia. Abbott was in a Sydney pub on Saturday evening when a group of Australian rules football players invited him to have a drink with them. The Prime Minister accepted and even gave a short, impromptu speech, one of the football coaches, Simon Carrodus, told The Australian Woman\\'s Weekly. \"Then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner, dribbling little bits on his shirt ... tipped it upside down on his head. And he was proud as punch,\" Carrodus said. A schooner holds about three-quarters of a pint. Video of Abbott making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants \"Skol! Skol!\" drew plenty of attention on social media. Some commentators focused on Abbott\\'s drinking technique. But others suggested he was setting a bad example. Abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year. \"Like most Australians, I enjoy a drink on social occasions,\" he said in January 2014. \"However, as a father and as a citizen, I\\'m appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent, especially at \"hot spots\" in our big cities.\" Casting those concerns aside, some social media users belittled Abbott\\'s beer swilling. They said his effort was a pale imitation of the legendary drinking exploits of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who is credited with drinking two and a half pints in 11 seconds.',\n",

It began to sail toward the island of Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos when it was caught in bad weather, civil protection spokesman Joseph Edgar Celestin said.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Italians have a saying: \"Too much of something cripples it.\" We\\'re overcrowded with so many frescoed churches, medieval castles and Roman ruins that we simply don\\'t know what to do with them, let alone care for a proper upkeep. We\\'ve turned blind to their value and beauty. There are nearly 5,000 \"gems\" scattered across the country, ranging from museums to archaeological areas and monuments. Italy boasts the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage sites in the world -- 50, several of which risk crumbling to the ground due to neglect and lack of public resources. And there are another 42,000 that are at the mercy of mudslides, floods and natural calamities. The UNESCO-listed Basilica of Assisi, where St. Frances\\' tomb lies, is just the last of a series of national shames. Its frescoed walls by Renaissance masters including Giotto risk falling down and are badly in need of a restyle. In a desperate move the monks have launched a crowdfunding project to raise 500,000 euros. We\\'re talking of one of the biggest pilgrimage sites in the world -- not to mention its artistic value. I remember once an American colleague asking me: \"But what does Italy do with its immense cultural heritage\"? Good question. If other nations had half as much of what we boast, they\\'d make a much better job with it. Paradoxically, if we had just the Coliseum or Venice it would be easier. But we don\\'t and trouble is Italy doesn\\'t know how to exploit this treasure. Take the British Museum\\'s successful exhibition on Pompeii in 2013: we have the real site in our backyard but the British made the best of it worldwide while the real Pompeii was -- and still is -- making global headlines just because of its frequent collapses. Or, worse, Italy couldn\\'t care less to promote its assets. As a travel writer I have the misfortune of dealing with tourist offices almost on a daily basis and it\\'s a battle: many are reluctant to give information and have no good photos of places. I find myself almost begging them, when it should be the other way round. The true but sad thing is that restyling in Italy is mainly thanks to private funds and sponsors. Crowdfunding has already saved Bologna\\'s San Luca Portico. The Coliseum is getting a makeover thanks to shoe brand Todd\\'s, while a few visionary businessmen are rescuing crumbling villages by turning them into luxury resorts. Yet it\\'s not just a matter of scarce public resources or austerity-driven measures. It\\'s also about not having a sense of artistic and cultural attachment, the care to cherish a country\\'s valuable monuments. And that\\'s because Italians have always lacked a sense of national belonging: Italy, despite its millenary history, is one of the world\\'s most modern states, unified in 1861. Patriot Massimo D\\'Azeglio once said: \"Now that we\\'ve made Italy, we need to make Italians.\" Tough job indeed, and we\\'re still a long way to go. There\\'s also wide-spread approach that tends to limit restyling in general. Heritage authorities are in love with the Romantic ideal \"of decadent ruins\": better leave the monument or site as it is, even allow it to rot, rather than recover it and \"destroy its original beauty.\" Each time new subway works bring to light an unknown Roman theatre or necropoli, it all freezes - the public works and the artistic upkeep. Preservation is equal to negligence and oblivion. But that\\'s a blind approach. There\\'s so much Italy could do with what it has, that it could live off tourism.  Symbola Foundation estimates that culture and art, if well exploited, could generate a turnover of 214 billion euros a year, amounting to 15.3% of GDP. Another thorny issue is having a cheap culture. Entrance tickets to the Coliseum, Italy\\'s top site that each year lures more than 6 million tourists, cost a maximum of 12 euros. Matera\\'s rock crypts are 5 euros. Not to mention churches featuring Michelangelo\\'s works, which are free to enter. The first time I visited Westminster Abbey in London, and St. Patrick\\'s church in Dublin, I was shocked to find out I had to pay to get in. And it was quite expensive, too. One could argue that Italy does well to open for free the Lord\\'s doors, but probably in some \"critical\" cases a minimum cost to enter wouldn\\'t hurt. The country\\'s mindset needs to change, too. Monuments and works of art are not dead, but living things that deserve to be sexed-up once in a while. If we don\\'t have enough space to showcase all of them or the money for their maintenance, why not give them over to other countries to run? Or sell them to rich businessmen? Similar options make state authorities\\' hair stand on end: they stress art belongs to the Italian people and should remain in public hands -- even if it\\'s inaccessible and unenjoyable. Yet is it better to have a public ruin or a private, thriving multimedia museum? The Uffizi Galleries\\' secret cellars are stacked with 2,500 forgotten masterpieces, which could be leased out to privates. Curators fear the artworks could get damaged if moved. But cobwebs and dust can do no harm, right? Our sunny piazzas, bridges and frescoed castles should be regularly rented out for lavish ceremonies and weddings of billionaires couples or for major company events that would bring millions of euros to cities\\' coffers. And who cares if for one single evening residents are unable to park their car in front of their palazzo? There are also 6,000 abandoned medieval \"ghost towns\" that could be recovered or sold to revamp local economy. The state should also speed up the process of putting up for auction hundreds of artistic sites and historical buildings to privates and international investors who get to run them for 50 years. Since the project launch in 2012 so far just two restyles have worked out, one being a Renaissance villa in Florence turned into a deluxe spa resort. Fine, Rome wasn\\'t built in a day. But it could crumble in an hour.',\n",

Khaled Batarfi, a senior al Qaeda figure, was among the escapees, officials said. Dozens of attackers took control of government buildings, including the city's Central Prison, Central Bank and radio station during the assault early Thursday, according to officials. Government troops arrived early Thursday and clashed with the al Qaeda fighters, and most of the militants fled, the officials said. Last month, hundreds of inmates escaped from Al Mansoorah Central Prison in Aden after clashes between Shiite Houthi rebels and forces loyal to ousted Sunni President  Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Shiite Houthi rebels removed Hadi, a Sunni, from power. The sectarian nature of the conflict is drawing in regional rivals Saudi Arabia, which is predominately Sunni -- and is the country to which Hadi ultimately fled -- and Iran, which is predominately Shiite and supports the Houthi rebels. Because of that, the conflict in Yemen risks becoming a proxy war in the struggle between the Iranians and the Saudis for preeminence in the Middle East. The Saudis have conducted airstrikes against the Houthi rebels and could send in ground troops. But little is simple in the Middle East. And while the conflict between the Houthis and forces loyal to Hadi rages in the western part of the country, where it has caused hundreds of civilian deaths, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, controls parts of eastern Yemen. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Five young men were arrested Saturday in Melbourne, Australia, in what police called a major counterterrorism operation. Three of the teens, all of them either 18 or 19, have since been released \"pending further enquiries,\" Australia\\'s Federal Police said, but two remain in custody. Sevdet Besim, 18, has been charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act, and was denied bail Saturday. The other suspect, a 19-year-old, has not yet appeared in court. \"Some evidence that we have collected at a couple of the scenes and some other information we have leads us to believe that this particular matter was ISIS-inspired,\" said Neil Gaughan, acting deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The suspects planned to attack during a major national commemoration in a week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Saturday. \"The act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers,\" he said. There was also a risk to the public, police said. Police said the suspects were targeting a ceremony on Anzac Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps Day), which is April 25 and this year is the centennial of the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I. Abbott avoided the term ISIS -- or Islamic State -- to call out those who authorities believed influenced the suspects. He instead referred to the group as the \"Daesh death cult,\" employing the acronym that is transliterated from the group\\'s name in Arabic. It\\'s a handle ISIS is known to loathe. Police also distanced the suspects from any ethnic connection. The men \"are individuals acting by themselves. They are not representatives of any religious, cultural or national group,\" Victoria Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said. \"I think the entire Australian community should be concerned about the young age of those particular men,\" Gaughan said. \"And this is an issue not just with law enforcement, but for the broader community. ... We need to get better in relation to identifying young men and woman involved in this type of behavior, at the very early stage.\" The suspects were associates of 18-year-old Nadun Haider, who was killed while stabbing officers at a police station in September, police said. Abbott lamented a string of extremist attacks on Australian soil. In December, Australian authorities stormed a Sydney chocolate cafe where a self-styled Muslim cleric had been holding hostages, killing the gunman. Two of the 17 hostages initially held by the gunman died. In February, two men were charged with plotting terror activities in Sydney. Despite distancing the suspects from religion, Abbott did make a connection to the Middle East. \"There are now about a hundred Australians who are fighting with terrorists in the Middle East,\" and another 150 people in Australia support them with funds and recruiting, the Prime Minister said. In February, Abbott announced tougher citizenship laws as a part of the government\\'s new counterterrorism strategy. Authorities have suspended Australian passports of those they suspect of terrorist activity. Australians should be stoic about the threat of terrorism, Abbott said Saturday. \"The best thing you can do in the face of those who would do us harm is live your life normally.\" He asked Australians to turn out in droves on Anzac Day.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)The mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, which began 100 years ago Friday, is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century, even though the word \"genocide\" did not exist at the time. The issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional, both for Armenians, who are descended from those killed, and for Turks, the heirs to the Ottomans. For both groups, the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts. Some Armenians feel their nationhood cannot be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged. Some Turks still view the Armenians as having been a threat to the Ottoman Empire in a time of war, and say many people of various ethnicities -- including Turks -- were killed in the chaos of war. In addition, some Turkish leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations. So, what do we know about happened in those fateful days? Here are some answers: . The Ottoman Turks, having recently entered World War I on the side of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were worried that Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire would offer wartime assistance to Russia. Russia had long coveted control of Constantinople (now Istanbul), which controlled access to the Black Sea -- and therefore access to Russia\\'s only year-round seaports. Many historians agree that the number was about 2 million. However, victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million Armenians living in the Caucasus under Russian rule, some of whom were massacred by Ottoman forces in 1918 as they marched through East Armenia and Azerbaijan. By 1914, Ottoman authorities were already portraying Armenians as a threat to the empire\\'s security. Then, on the night of April 23-24, 1915, the authorities in Constantinople, the empire\\'s capital, rounded up about 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. Many of them ended up deported or assassinated. April 24, known as Red Sunday, is commemorated as Genocide Remembrance Day by Armenians around the world. Friday is the 100th anniversary of that day. This is a major point of contention. Estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923, with not all of the victims in the Ottoman Empire. But most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918, made by Ottoman authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million. Whether due to killings or forced deportation, the number of Armenians living in Turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922. Almost any way one can imagine. While the  death toll is in dispute, photographs from the era document some mass killings. Some show Ottoman soldiers posing with severed heads, others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt. The victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning, torture, gas, poison, disease and starvation. Children were reported to have been loaded into boats, taken out to sea and thrown overboard. Rape, too, was frequently reported. In addition, according to the website armenian-genocide.org, \"The great bulk of the Armenian population was forcibly removed from Armenia and Anatolia to Syria, where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger.\" No. Genocide was not even a word at the time, much less a legally defined crime. The word \"genocide\" was invented in 1944 by a Polish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin to describe the Nazis\\' systematic attempt to eradicate Jews from Europe. He formed the word by combining the Greek word for race with the Latin word for killing. Genocide became a crime in 1948, when the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The definition included acts meant \"to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\" Armenia, the Vatican, the European Parliament, France, Russia and Canada. Germany is expected to join that group on Friday, the 100th anniversary of the start of the killings. Turkey, the United States, the European Commission, the United Kingdom and the United Nations. A U.N. subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985, but current U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declines to use the word. Also, a year ago, on the eve of the 99th anniversary of Red Sunday, then-Turkish Prime Minister (now-President) Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences for the mass killings, which he said had \"inhumane consequences.\" While Turkey vehemently continues to reject the word \"genocide,\" his remarks went further than those of any previous Turkish leader in acknowledging the suffering of Armenians.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)The world\\'s seventh-largest economy is heading toward collapse. An economic powerhouse conservatively valued at $24 trillion, one that annually churns out the equivalent of $2.5 trillion, is under assault. However, I am not referring to one of the G8 economies, but to the \"super economy\" of the ocean. It\\'s one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted -- and it is going downhill fast. The health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a WWF report released Thursday, Reviving the Ocean Economy. The report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by The Boston Consulting Group built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the Global Change Institute of the University of Queensland. True, the enormity of the ocean can complicate any single appraisal. But it is still important to try to understand its value if global leaders are ever going to sustain it for future generations. The fact is that the ocean feeds us, employs us, offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world. The ocean also provides intangible but essential services to humanity, such as climate regulation and oxygen production, that are difficult to put in monetary terms. And while we all may look at the ocean from different perspectives, no one can escape the fact that it is a shared resource that provides for each and every one of us. A figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling: Seventy percent of the ocean\\'s overall economic value relies on its continued health. Ocean assets like fisheries, coral reefs, mangroves and seagrasses that produce goods and services rivaling the world\\'s top 10 economies will lose their value if we continue to over-exploit and outright destroy them. That may seem like a far-off possibility to some, but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report. For example, 90 percent of the world\\'s fish stocks are either fully exploited or over-exploited. And that is not all. By 2050 -- only a few decades from now -- it is possible that the ocean could lose its coral reefs, which have already been halved in the last few decades. This isn\\'t just a concern for dive enthusiasts, but to the hundreds of millions of people that rely on ocean resources for their daily meals and their weekly paychecks. The ocean is truly too big to fail. The loss of the ocean\\'s critical habitats and species would have a devastating ripple effect on global food security and economies that no government bailout could salvage. Fortunately, our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy, three of which are critical this year. First, the international community must rally around a set of sustainable development goals that clearly reflect the link between the environment -- including the ocean -- and human well-being. Also, negotiators meeting in Paris later this year must agree on an ambitious global climate deal that sets us on the path to avert the worst impacts of climate change. And finally, leaders must commit to conserving increasing amounts of coastal and marine areas over the course of the next 15 years. The economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear, and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy. Reviving the Ocean Economy is dedicated to helping us avoid that outcome, but it will require political vision and courage among policymakers. All this said, and as terrifying as it is that the deterioration of the ocean\\'s health has been its fastest in millions of years, there is actually some (potential) good news: If we act swiftly and with determination, marine resources can recover -- and recover quickly. Many local examples -- from the Mediterranean to the Mozambique Channel, from the Fiji archipelago to the Arctic -- show us that conservation, restoration and sustainable-use approaches mean the ocean, and the people who depend on it, can both prosper. Ultimately, the ocean bridges continents, connects cultures and offers equal opportunity inspiration and we should therefore work together in support of this vital shared resource. But if we are to have any chance of avoiding the point of no return, we must find ways of reaching genuine global commitments on sustainable development and climate. After all, it\\'s far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Five years ago, Rebecca Francis posed for a photo while lying next to a dead giraffe. This week, she got threatened for her action. The trouble started Monday, when comedian Ricky Gervais tweeted the photo with a question. \"What must\\'ve happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal & then lie next to it smiling?\" Gervais wrote. In the past three days, his tweet has been retweeted almost 30,000 times. A number of people insulted and threatened Francis in response to the giraffe photo and others featuring her. On the website rebeccafrancis.com, there are photos of Francis with other animals, including a lion, which other Twitterers responded to. Francis, who has appeared on the NBC Sports Network outdoor lifestyle show \"Eye of the Hunter\" and was the subject of an interview with Hunting Life in late March, responded in a statement to HuntingLife.com on Tuesday, which was posted on its Facebook page. The death came about, she said, because she was asked by others on an African hunt to \"preserve\" him for the local people. \"(The locals) showed me this beautiful old bull giraffe that was wandering all alone. He had been kicked out of the herd by a younger and stronger bull. He was past his breeding years and very close to death,\" she said. \"They asked me if I would preserve this giraffe by providing all the locals with food and other means of survival. ... I chose to honor his life by providing others with his uses and I do not regret it for one second. (The locals) did not waste a single part of him. I am grateful to be a part of something so good.\" According to the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, there are about 80,000 giraffes in Africa, a decline of 60,000 in the past 15 years. On a website called rebeccafrancis.com, where the photo is posted, Francis describes herself as a longtime outdoors enthusiast and a fan of bow-hunting. \"I prefer bowhunting, and the animals I have taken with a bow include: a 10 1/2 ft. brown bear, black bear, shiras moose, alaskan moose,  dall sheep, stone sheep, desert bighorn ram, rocky mountain bighorn ram, mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, mountain goat, antelope, arapawa ram, kudu, zebra, black wildebeest, giraffe, springbuck, blesbuck, lynx, badger, and squirrel,\" she writes. \"I have also taken many of the same species and more with a rifle.\" She has achieved the \"Full Curl of North American sheep\" with a bow, according to the Hunting Life interview, and hopes to achieve the \"Super 10.\" The latter, according to liveoutdoors.com, \"entails the taking of one animal from the ten basic North American species: bears, cats, deer, elk, caribou, moose, bison/muskox, goat, antelope and sheep.\" Tom Opre, the producer and co-host of \"Eye of the Hunter,\" says she won the first season of \"Extreme Huntress,\" an online offshoot of \"Eye,\" and co-hosted a handful of \"Eye\" episodes.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Soon, America will be too fat to fight. Forget about rampant diabetes, heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country. In about five years, so many young Americans will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. That alarming forecast comes from Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, who is in charge of U.S. Army Recruiting Command. Obesity, he told me, \"is becoming a national security issue.\" I was so taken aback by Batschelet\\'s statement that I felt the need to press him. Come on! Obesity? A national security crisis? The General didn\\'t blink. \"In my view, yes.\" Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn\\'t make the cut because they had a criminal background, or a lack of education, or too many tattoos. But a full 10% didn\\'t qualify because they were overweight. Before you accuse me of sensationalizing, it\\'s that 10% figure that worries General Batschelet the most. \"The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50%, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army.\" He paused. \"It\\'s a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.\" The problem is so worrisome for the Army that recruiters have become fitness coaches, like the trainers on the NBC show, \"The Biggest Loser.\" Yes, your tax dollars pay for Army recruiters to play Dolvett Quince or Jillian Michaels to whip could-be recruits into shape with the hope they can diet and exercise their way to become real recruits. If they lose enough weight, they\\'re sent to boot camp. Some make it; many don\\'t. But, General Batschelet told me the Army must try. \"We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,\" he told me. \"We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.\" Except the Army never considered the type of growth it\\'s now contending with. Nowadays \"personal development\" means working on both character and ... girth. The general, along with so many others in this country, is struggling with why so many Americans, despite all the warnings, continue to eat too much and exercise too little. I have a theory. It ain\\'t pretty. But it\\'s got to be true: We just don\\'t care. \"The acceptance of obesity is prevalent,\" according to Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now. \"When you look around you, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. It\\'s seems normal,\" she said. Just look at the numbers: More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese. That\\'s triple the rate from just a generation ago. So, maybe we should face the fact that we\\'ve grown comfortable with our girth. It is crystal clear we haven\\'t the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who doesn\\'t. Just the other day, Twitter trolls scolded the singer, Pink, for gaining weight. Pink is not remotely fat. Neither is Selena Gomez, haters. Or Britney Spears, hecklers. If 70% of us are overweight in this country, why are there so many willing to fat-shame people who are not remotely obese? Maybe it\\'s easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves. Because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial. Dr. Putnam points to one of Kaiser Permanante\\'s medical questionnaires. You know, the paperwork patients are asked to fill out before they see the doctor. There is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to \"opt out of talking about obesity.\" Some patients refuse to step on the scale. \"You want to be sensitive to that patient,\" Putnam told me. \"You don\\'t want to nag. But, doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this.\" CNN\\'s chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, agrees with Putnam. \"Perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem,\" he said to me. \"If a person is overweight -- as difficult as it is -- they ought to be told. You know, this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions. We should call them what they really are: a brain injury, not \\'getting your bell rung.\\' In the same vein, we should tell people who are overweight or obese that, clinically, they\\'re \\'overweight\\' or \\'obese\\' and at risk for just about every chronic disease in the book.\" In other words, chubby is not the proper way to describe a person who is obese. Just like \"fat\" is not the proper term for Pink or Selena Gomez. And, yes, semantics matter. According to the CDC, 81% of overweight boys and 71% of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. We\\'ve clearly lost our perspective on what\\'s normal when it comes to a healthy weight. So much so it\\'s becoming a national security problem. So what will it take? The answer cannot be the U.S Army.',\n",

The league hired attorney Ted Wells -- who also investigated the Miami Dolphins bullying scandal -- to run the investigation. Jeff Pash, the NFL\\'s executive vice president and chief counsel, is assisting Wells in the effort. The league has also retained Renaissance Associates, an investigatory firm with sophisticated forensic expertise, to assist in reviewing electronic and video information. But three months later, it\\'s still not clear when the investigation will be completed and when the findings will be announced. \"We have not put a time frame on Ted Wells,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said March 25. \"We asked him to be thorough, complete and when he is finished with that -- he\\'ll give that to us and to the public in general.\" On Monday, CNN reached out to Wells and the NFL for an update on the investigation but has not heard back. On January 18, the Patriots beat the Indianapolis Colts 45-7 to advance to the Super Bowl. They scored 28 of their points in the second half -- after game officials had pumped the balls back up to their regulation pressure -- so it\\'s unlikely that the ball pressure made much difference in the outcome of the game. In February, Colts General Manager Ryan Grigson said at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis that prior to the AFC Championship game, his team notified the league of its concerns about the footballs. \"We went into the game, we had some issues, but we are going to do what we can and that\\'s to participate with the league and the investigation and wait until the Wells report comes out,\" Grigson said February 19. \"We really have no other recourse than to wait until that investigation comes out.\" Each team provides a dozen footballs to the referee for testing two hours and 15 minutes before kickoff. The home team also supplies 12 backup balls, and for outdoor games, the visiting team has the option of bringing another 12 balls. NFL rules state the referee \"shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications. A pump is to be furnished by the home club, and the balls shall remain under the supervision of the Referee until they are delivered to the ball attendant just prior to the start of the game.\" The ball attendant brings the footballs to the field, and ball boys keep them on the sideline. It\\'s been speculated that deflated footballs are easier to grip for the quarterback and receivers. However, there isn\\'t a consensus by players on that view. The day after the AFC Championship game, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady called the accusation of using deflated footballs \"ridiculous.\" A few days later, he told reporters he has always played by the rules. Following a practice on January 24, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said that the Patriots try to do everything right. \"At no time was there any intent whatsoever to try to compromise the integrity of the game or to gain an advantage,\" Belichick said at the time. \"Quite the opposite, we feel like we follow the rules of the game to the letter in our preparations, in our procedures.\" After arriving in Arizona for Super Bowl XLIX, Patriots owner Robert Kraft said he expects the NFL to apologize if the investigation does not uncover any wrongdoing. \"Many jump to conclusions and made strong accusations against our coach, quarterback, and staff questioning the integrity of all involved,\" Kraft said then. \"If the Wells investigation is not able to definitely determine that our organization tampered with the air pressure in the footballs, I would expect and hope the league would apologize to our entire team and in particular coach Belichick and Tom Brady for what they have had to endure this past week.\" In terms of punishment, the Patriots could be fined and/or docked a draft pick. After Spygate in 2007 -- where the Patriots illegally videotaped the New York Jets defensive coaches\\' signals -- the league took away a Patriots first-round draft pick, fined the team $250,000 and fined Belichick $500,000. However, it\\'s not expected that the punishment would be that serious for Deflategate. In March, two other teams were punished by the NFL for different rules violations. Cleveland Browns General Manager Ryan Farmer admitted to using his phone to text the Browns staffers during games during the 2014 season. It\\'s against the rules to use certain electronic devices during games. Farmer will be suspended without pay for the first four regular-season games of the 2015 season, and the Browns were fined $250,000. During the suspension, Farmer cannot be involved in any team matters and is prohibited from being at the Browns\\' offices, practice facility or at Browns games. According to the league, there was no evidence in the NFL\\'s review that Browns ownership or any other team executives had knowledge of the prohibited conduct. The Atlanta Falcons acknowledged the use of prerecorded crowd noise, which is also a violation of NFL rules, during home games in the 2013 and into the 2014 season. The rule states that \"at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium.\" The Falcons were fined $350,000 and lose their fifth-round draft pick in the 2016 NFL draft. The league\\'s investigation found that the Falcons\\' former director of event marketing was directly responsible, but that senior executives, including team president Rich McKay, were unaware of the use of the piped-in crowd noise. Still, McKay was suspended from the NFL Competition Committee starting April 1. Starting June 30, he can petition Goodell for reinstatement to the committee. As to what happens to the Patriots, and when, it\\'s still anyone\\'s guess. But Goodell has previously stated that a violation of rules will be taken seriously. \"Whenever there is a charge potentially of the violations of our  rules, we take it very seriously and that\\'s our obligation,\" Goodell said in March. \"That\\'s our obligation to the other 31 clubs. Ted Wells will be going through the report. If there is anything that we as a league did incorrectly we will know about it in that report.\" What the heck is Deflategate?',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Sleek chassis, alluring paintwork and a need for speed, but these are no ordinary motors. When pedal hits metal, an eco-friendly process gets set in motion. Powered by electricity and engineered for efficiency, car enthusiasts from across Africa are sparking home-grown concepts that have gotten experts revving. In Zaria, a city in northern Nigeria, a team of students from the Ahmadu Bello University are currently applying the final touches to the \"ABUCAR 2.\" The students used locally available materials to build the vehicle, and even included recycled electrical components in the engine. While it runs on gasoline, the engine maximizes fuel efficiency and produces fewer emissions than normal cars. \"We are sure we have a great car,\" says the project\\'s supervisor Muhammad Dauda. \"Now we are focusing on making some final enhancements to hone the driving strategy -- this is just like Formula One.\" Their compact creation, which was built over five months, will travel to The Netherlands in May to compete in the European leg of this year\\'s Shell Eco-marathon -- the motoring competition rewards those who travel the longest distance using the least amount of fuel. But the team is also working towards a hybrid petro-electric motor, which they hope to unveil in 2016. At low speeds the vehicle will be powered by electricity alone, but at higher speeds both electric and petrol components will work together. Between extremes, excess power generated by the engine recharges the batteries that power the electric motor. It\\'s the model that Toyota uses in the Prius. Green-focused designs like these are increasingly needed on the continent, as some studies say 50% of global emissions of organic carbon could come from Africa in 2030. At May\\'s Shell Eco-marathon, ABUCAR\\'s team will be hoping to race past the sleek \"Autonov III\" creation from the University of Lagos. Painted the colors of the Nigerian flag and powered by a solar battery, the car\\'s aerodynamic teardrop shape helps minimize drag. Constructing earlier iterations of this vehicle was put under stress in 2013 when university teachers went on a six month strike, but the industrial action didn\\'t stop the team from tinkering with the electric engine. \"We\\'ve used small tires to reduce the overall weight of the vehicle,\" explains team manager Chukwuemeka Isiogu. \"We\\'ve trained ourselves to just think about fuel efficiency and create the most efficient vehicle.\" Other eco-friendly engineers are less about sleek and more focused on comfort. Uganda\\'s Makerere University has produced a two-seater electric car called \"Kiira EV\". With a super-light fibreglass body and lithium ion battery, the car can go 50 miles on a single charge. The design project cost $35,000, but the engineers made sure to include leather seats and a CD player. Whilst working on the Kiira, the team is also developing an 28-seater electric bus which will run on a mixture of electric and solar power. Innovative creations have also come from the University of Benin in Nigeria. Their \"Tuke-Tuke\" car -- named after local mini-buses -- is made from locally available materials. The brake pads, for example, are made from palm kernels. Tuke-Tuke also has some key features that will come in handy when slipping through the city\\'s streets. Windscreen wipers start automatically when rain hits the sensors, gears can be changed with the touch of a button and owners use their finger rather than a key to unlock the doors. And when it gets dark, the driver just needs to clap their hands to turn on the interior lights. Elsewhere, engineers are working on green vehicles for the whole family. One Ghanaian inventor is building SUVs with electric motors powered by rechargeable batteries. Apostle Safo, who also founded a church, dreams big in his five-seater creations which are hand built in Gomoa Mpota, except for the headlights and tires. While he says the product will be affordable, it remains to be seen just how much a handmade SUV would cost. These innovations certainly are impressive concepts, but it\\'s unlikely electric vehicles will be filling roads on the continent any time soon -- it is unclear how economically viable it would be for governments and companies to build the right number of charging points, but the issue of power itself is even more pressing. \"Reliability when it comes to electricity supply is key,\" says South African sustainability consultant Anthony Dane. \"Convincing consumers across Africa to invest in an electric vehicle whilst electricity shortages are such a major issue in so many communities is a challenge.\" Read this: Africa\\'s 10 most prosperous countries .

              " {'sequence': 'Garissa, Kenya (CNN)Kenyan police have arrested five suspects in connection with Thursday\\'s attack at Garissa University College, Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said Friday, according to CNN affiliate NTV. Nkaissery told reporters the university will be able to confirm Saturday if everyone has been accounted for. Thursday\\'s attack by al-Shabaab militants killed 147 people, including 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel. The attack left 104 people injured, including 19 who are in critical condition, Nkaissery said. During search and recovery efforts on Friday, CNN witnessed one male who was not a student hiding under a bed. That male was taken into custody and was being treated as a suspect, sources close to the search told CNN. The find sparked an additional search of the building. Sources said three people, all students, were found alive. A female student was found under a pile of bodies, another female student was hiding in a wardrobe and a male student was hiding in the bathroom, the sources confirmed to CNN. Student Hellen Titus said she survived by fooling the attackers into thinking she was dead. After gunmen shot fellow students, she smeared their blood onto her body to make it seem she\\'d been shot, too, she told CNN on Friday at a makeshift center for evacuated students. \"In the time of shooting,\" she said, \"they skipped me.\" Most of the victims had been shot from behind, in the back of the head, a medic told CNN. \"They\\'re facing down, always,\" a worker with St. John\\'s ambulance service said Friday. \"They\\'re always facing down, and they\\'re shot in the heads, around the back.\" Al-Shabaab\\'s long, bloody legacy with Kenya . Early Thursday, an explosion and gunfire cut through the morning quiet on the campus about 90 miles (145 kilometers) from Kenya\\'s border with Somalia, tearing many students in dormitories out of their sleep. \"Never heard anything like this,\" journalist  Dennis Okari from CNN affiliate NTV tweeted as he watched smoke rising over a student hostel. Al-Shabaab gunmen had first stormed a Christian prayer service, where they killed some and took others hostage. Then they went across campus with them, shooting non-Muslims and sparing Muslims, a witness said. They headed for the hostels. Student Japhet Mwala lay in her bed. \"We were sleeping when we heard a loud explosion that was followed by gunshots, and everyone started running for safety,\" she told Agence France-Presse. Awaking to terror: \\'I am lucky to be alive\\' \"There are those who were not able to leave the hostels where the gunmen headed and started firing. I am lucky to be alive because I jumped through the fence with other students,\" she said. Students ran -- some crawled -- away from the gunfire, Okari said. At one point, the gunmen pinned down a building where 360 students lived, Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said. Okari took cover outside the campus and listened to explosions and gunfire for four hours. Kenyan security forces moved in and killed four gunmen. Somali terror group Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack. The Interior Ministry has posted a \"most wanted\" notice for a man in connection with it. It offered a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, about $215,000, for Mohamed Mohamud, who goes by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere. The post does not say what role the man may have played. Kenyan police are circulating \"Wanted Dead or Alive\" posters featuring eight terror suspects who are wanted in separate attacks in Kenya, the Interior Ministry said. Police are offering a bounty of more than $210,000 for the suspects, the Ministry said via Twitter. The dangerously porous border between Somalia and Kenya has made it easy for Al-Shabaab militants to cross over and carry out attacks. In a December attack at a quarry, Al-Shabaab militants separated Muslims from others and executed the non-Muslims, killing at least 36 people. In November, militants stopped a bus near the border and killed 28 people they believed to be non-Muslims. Last month, the U.S. Embassy warned of possible attacks \"throughout Kenya in the near-term\" after the reported death of a key Al-Shabaab leader, Adan Garaar, who was suspected in the September 2013 Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi. Opinion: A weakened Al-Shabaab lashes out . Police have declared a curfew for the next several days in the region from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. The Education Ministry has closed the university indefinitely. Surviving students have gathered in large groups at the town\\'s airport, waiting to be flown to their hometowns. The effects are also being felt 225 miles west in Kenya\\'s capital of Nairobi, where the new bloodshed reinvigorated an old debate: Is the nation\\'s security strong enough? Many thought measures taken after the Westgate Mall massacre had filled the gaps. At least 67 people died then. But Thursday\\'s attack is the second-worst in the country\\'s history, and it has evaporated much of the confidence won after Westgate. Civil liberty concerns had held up the enrollment of 10,000 new police recruits, but on Thursday, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta gave a directive to process them. \"Kenya badly needs additional officers,\" he said, \"and I will not keep the nation waiting.\" The problems plaguing Kenya\\'s security efforts .

              " {'sequence': 'Melbourne, Australia (CNN)A man stands on a beach in a distant land. Waves lap his ankles. He wades through the gentle dawn light, arms outstretched, his head held high. He is fully dressed; not a tourist but a freedom fighter. A photograph of this man, beamed around the world, becomes a universal symbol of the struggle against tyranny and the sweet triumph of liberty. It is 2015. The man is Peter Greste. If you thought the man might have been an Anzac on the shores of Gallipoli, such is the power of persuasion. It\\'s easy to lead a horse to water when, in the centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign, our nation is at saturation point with battlefield remembrance. The sum total of television programming, beer advertising, political grandstanding and opportunistic marketing suggests that the historical legacy of Australia\\'s involvement in the first world war boils down to a simple equation: young (white) man plus distant beach equals sacrifice. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with military commemoration that honors the dead. Last weekend I planted Gallipoli rosemary in my backyard; part of the proceeds go to the Avenues of Honour, a national project to preserve and restore Australia\\'s living memorials. More objectionable is the fact that war remembrance is played like it is a zero sum game. To widen the scope of historical tribute, and also recall the words and deeds of the Australian men and women who fought against the prescribed route of militaristic sentiment, is to risk being branded disrespectful and divisive. But the unassailable fact is that the first world war ripped Australia asunder. Even at the time, the Great War itself was divisive, a historical reality belied by today\\'s bland, blanket coverage of \"the Anzac spirit\". Australia\\'s participation in the war was contested from the outset. On August 11, 1914, veteran political campaigner Vida Goldstein wrote in her Woman Voter newspaper: \"It is a fearful reflection on 2,000 years of Christianity that men have rushed into war before using every combined effort to prevent this appalling conflict.\" As she had done 20 years earlier in mobilizing forces around the issue of female suffrage, Goldstein rallied her own army of foot soldiers with fighting words. \"The time has come for women to show that they, as givers of life, refuse to give their sons as material for slaughter.\" Australian and New Zealand women had a unique advantage in shaping public debate: the vote. \"The enfranchised women of Australia are political units in the British Empire,\" Goldstein argued, \"and they ought to lead the world in sane methods of dealing with these conflicts.\" Goldstein\\'s early entreaties failed to bite with the general populace. Under the newly legislated War Precautions Act, the Woman Voter suffered censorship, leading Goldstein and her Women\\'s Peace Army to fight on multiple fronts: \"We are fighting for Civil Liberty and against Military Despotism.\"  Around the nation, trade unionists opposed to \"the capitalist war\" joined the movement. Australia had the only entirely voluntary military service among the Allied forces; less than 40% of eligible men signed up to fight \"for King and Country.\" As the carnage at Gallipoli brought home the realities of war, recruitment fell and peace activism became more widespread. General strikes halted industry, as workers reacted to the food shortages, unemployment and rising poverty that threatened the social accord of \"the Working Man\\'s Paradise.\" With enlistments falling away in 1916, Prime Minister Billy Hughes pushed for conscription and pushed through the Unlawful Associations Act. Groups that voiced opposition to the war, like the International Workers of the World, were banned and dissidents were jailed for publishing material \"likely to cause disaffection or alarm\". When waterfront workers and coal miners went on strike, the War Precautions Act was invoked to send them back to work. In September 1916, the Sydney Twelve were arrested and tried for treason. \"Fifteen years for 15 words\" was how one of the prisoners described his crime and punishment. The conscription referendums of October 28, 1916, and December 20, 1917, became a massive rallying point for people who opposed the war — or the federal government\\'s domestic policies. There were diverse reasons for that opposition, including the anti-British sentiments of Irish Catholic Australians. In Melbourne, the meeting place for such public debate was Yarra Bank, a pocket of land nestled between what today is Birrarung Marr and the Rod Laver Arena. Anti-conscription demonstrations saw up to 100,000 people gather on the dusty banks of dirty brown Yarra River. Most protest meetings were peaceful, but one became infamously violent. \"Riotous scenes at Yarra Bank\", headlines around the nation proclaimed, when a demonstration organized by the Women\\'s Peace Army in the week before the 1916 referendum turned nasty and returned servicemen began to attack female speakers. Both conscription referendums ultimately failed. The Australian Dictionary of Biography contains profiles of 174 anti-conscriptionists, many of whom went to jail, including Vida Goldstein\\'s compatriots Adela Pankhurst and Jennie Baines. Baines was imprisoned for refusing to pay the fine she was issued for flying a red flag at Yarra Bank in 1918. She is reputedly the first Australian prisoner to go on a hunger strike. Other protesters were deported. As historian Janet Butler reminds us: \"It does take a special kind of bravery to stand against the tide.\" The enduring legacies of the first world war emanate beyond the battlefields of Gallipoli, manifested not only in the \"shattered Anzacs\" whose families bore the burden of care, but also in the class and sectarian divisions that shaped Australia\\'s social and political relations in the 20th century. Lest we also forget that the democratic freedoms we hold dear today -- freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech — were won in battles fought on home soil by courageous women and men who sacrificed much, but are still accorded little recognition. Perhaps, by the 125th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, when we again celebrate our national liberation narratives, we will come to associate riverbanks, as well as beaches, with the potent ebb and flow of freedom.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Sophisticated, glamorous and spacious -- when the super-rich go house-hunting they are searching for something special. Real estate in London\\'s swankier suburbs can catch a buyers\\' eye. Mayfair, Kensington and Chelsea have long been the stomping ground of the elite -- and are now welcoming a new wave of African investors. \"The Africans who are coming into London now are Africans who themselves have worked for their money,\" explains Bimpe Nkontchou, a British-Nigerian wealth manager based in London. \"They have grown in industry and are actually part of the exciting story of the African renaissance,\" she continues. \"It\\'s bringing to London the best of the continent.\" These investors are having a considerable impact on London\\'s property market and they mainly come from just six countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Senegal. Of these, Nigerians are splashing out the most cash when it comes to bricks and mortar in the British capital -- typically spending between $22 and $37 million on securing a property, according to luxury property agents Beauchamp Estates. Their research shows that over the past three years Africans have spent over $900 million on luxury residential property in London. \"The new international African is very well-traveled,\" explains Nkontchou. \"Educated in the U.S., UK and different parts of Europe their taste is definitely more modern and clean.\" \\'Safe-Haven\\' Owning a home in post codes like W1 or W8 -- around the corner from Kensington Palace -- means more than having a place to lay your head. These buildings are investments which are expected to gain even bigger value in the coming years. High-end auction house Sotheby\\'s says that foreign investors see London as a \"safe haven\"  for prime property investments, and ranks the city as the second most important hub for ultra high-net-worth homes. The only spot more important on the planet is New York City. For evidence that London still attracts high-end buyers, look no further than the sale of a penthouse in Mayfair which fetched $40 million earlier this year. Educated thinking . As well as an intelligent investment, many of the African buyers see these houses as a way of maintaining long standing cultural ties with London -- and it\\'s here they want to send their children to school. Harrow, Eton, Cheltenham Ladies College are all among the list of respected institutions that teach the offspring of wealthy Africans. The Nigerian Embassy in London calculates that Nigerian nationals now spend over $446 million per year on fees, tutoring and accommodation at British schools and university. \"West African clients are very much driven by the need to educate their children,\" says Nkontchou. \"Education usually means putting the children on an international stage, and that\\'s one reason why this is feeding into the demand for property in London.\" Indeed, education industry experts ICEF Monitor say there were over 17,500 Nigerians studying in British universities in 2012  -- about 1,000 more than the 2009/10 academic session. And experts are expecting this trend to continue. \"Virtually all the transactions are for end use, not rental investment, which indicates that the African buyer market in London has significant room for growth,\" says Gary Hersham, director at Beauchamp Estates. \"African buyers or luxury tenants in London are currently where the Russians and Ukrainians were five years ago. They have the resources and desire to purchase or rental luxury homes in Prime Central London,\" he adds. \"It is going to be the African century.\"More from Marketplace Africa .

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)It\\'s a warm afternoon in Miami, and 35-year-old Emanuel Vega has come to Baptist Health Primary Care for a physical exam. Dr. Mark Caruso shakes his hand with a welcoming smile. Vega, a strapping man with a thick black beard, is feeling good, but he came to see the doctor today because his wife thought he should -- she even made the appointment. It is free to him under his insurance policy with no co-pay, as most preventive care is under the Affordable Care Act. Vega is one of more than 44 million Americans who is taking part in a medical ritual: visiting the doctor for an annual physical exam. But there\\'s little evidence that those visits actually do any good for healthy adults. Caruso listens to Vega\\'s heart and lungs, checks his pulse in his ankles and feels around his lymph nodes. He also asks Vega about his exercise and sleeping schedule and orders blood and urine tests. As long as everything checks out, Caruso asks Vega to return for another exam in a year. Vega says he definitely will. It was a positive experience for both doctor and patient, and they\\'re not alone; 92 percent of Americans say it is important to get an annual head-to-toe physical exam, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation). And 62 percent of those polled said they went to the doctor every year for their exam. But the evidence is not on their side. \"I would argue that we should move forward with the elimination of the annual physical,\" says Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, a primary care physician and a professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School. Mehrotra says patients should really only go to the doctor if something is wrong, or if it\\'s time to have an important preventive test like a colonoscopy. He realizes popular opinion is against this view. \"When I, as a doctor, say I do not advocate for the annual physical, I feel like I\\'m attacking moms and apple pie,\" Mehrotra says. \"It seems so intuitive and straightforward, and [it\\'s] something that\\'s been part of medicine for such a long time.\" But he says randomized trials going back to the 1980s just don\\'t support it. The Society for General Internal Medicine even put annual physicals on a list of things doctors should avoid for healthy adults. One problem, Mehrotra says, is the cost. Each visit usually costs insurers just $150, but that adds up fast. \"We estimate that it\\'s about $10 billion a year, which is more than how much we spend as a society on breast cancer care,\" Mehrotra says. \"It\\'s all a lot of money.\" And then there\\'s the risk that a doctor will run a test and find a problem that\\'s not actually there. It\\'s called a false positive, and it can lead to a cascade of follow-up tests that can be expensive and could even cause real harm. Dr. Michael Rothberg is another primary care physician and a health researcher at the Cleveland Clinic. He generally avoids giving physicals. \"I generally don\\'t like to frighten people and I don\\'t like to give them diseases they don\\'t have,\" Rothberg says. \"I mostly tell my family, \\'if you\\'re feeling well, stay away from doctors. If you get near them, they\\'ll start to look for things and order tests because that\\'s what doctors do.\\' \" \"The flip side of that is if you\\'re not feeling well, don\\'t keep it to yourself. Don\\'t minimize it. Don\\'t pretend it\\'s not there,\" he adds. Rothberg says he still has patients who always schedule an annual exam. For those patients, he skips the physical aspects of the exam and focuses instead on talking to them about their dietary and exercise habits, possible risks, age-appropriate vaccinations and any screening tests they may need. The guidelines discouraging annual physicals are aimed specifically at asymptomatic adults. Dr. David Fleming, president of the American College of Physicians, says it\\'s important for elderly patients to be seen on a regular basis, to \"do a full assessment of everything -- how they live at home, if the conditions are safe, are they at risk of falling?

And it\\'s also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the atrocity. It\\'s a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes.

But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. \"We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Robert Downey Jr. is making headlines for walking out of an interview with a British journalist who dared to veer away from the superhero movie Downey was there to promote. The journalist instead started asking personal questions about the actor\\'s political beliefs and \"dark periods\" of addiction and jail time. Twitter, of course, is abuzz: Did journalist Krishnan Guru-Murthy go too far? Must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he\\'d like? From the start of the 7-minute television interview, it seems evident that Downey is not particularly interested in being there, even if being there was, ultimately, a benefit to him -- after all, he\\'s promoting his latest film, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" He grows increasingly agitated, even as the line of questioning remains on-topic; his attitude, meanwhile, grew increasingly smug. His eyes glaze over as the reporter talks, he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he\\'s much smarter than Guru-Murthy, and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say, \"Do I really have to sit here with this guy?\" At one point, he makes fun of Guru-Murthy for seeming nervous, saying, \"Your foot is starting to jump a little bit. You better get to your next question.\" But it\\'s after Guru-Murthy asks Downey whether he thinks he is \"free from all of that,\" referring to Downey\\'s history of \"taking drugs, drinking\" that the building tension comes to a head. \"I\\'m sorry,\" says Downey, \"What are we doing?\" To which Guru-Murthy replies, \"I\\'m just asking questions,\" which indeed was so. Downey has the right to refuse to answer the question, of course, but that\\'s not what he does next. Instead, he throws the celebrity interview equivalent of a tantrum: He smiles arrogantly, says \"bye!\" and stands up to leave. He sure showed him! It\\'s true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they\\'re dating, what they\\'re eating, where they vacation, what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago. Journalists often go too far, even if it\\'s their job. And certainly not every journalist is good at his job. But while Downey may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past, questions that have been asked before, his business is our business. The entertainment industry is about entertaining people. As such, we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched. This is why most celebrities, especially those with a big budget movie to promote, agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general. But when the recognition no longer serves them? Then they want to bemoan it? What Downey seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions. That\\'s what an interview is. He certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate, or even ones he simply doesn\\'t feel like answering. But he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude, demeaning, and disrespectful -- even if he\\'s a celebrity, and even if he felt uncomfortable or put-off. What the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak. After he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves, the actor cannot resist a parting shot. He turns to the reporter, being sure to look directly at the camera on the way, and says, \"You seem okay. It\\'s just getting a little Diane Sawyer in here,\" followed by what sounds like, \"and you\\'re kind of a schmuck.\" Downey might not have been \"in the mood\" to be questioned... and those days, those moods, are understandable. We all have them. And yet in this case, that\\'s, well, too bad. The actor has agreed to an interview as part of his job. He has agreed to engage in a conversation with another professional human being. Given the terms, he is not entitled to call all the shots. That he thinks he can is perhaps our own, celebrity-obsessed doing -- we revere the famous; is it any surprise when they reveal that they, too, regard themselves as better than everyone else? But it\\'s still on him.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch, more Americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking, concludes a major study of alcohol use. Heavy drinking among Americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012, largely due to rising rates among women, according to the study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men. Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month. The increases are driven largely by women\\'s drinking habits as social norms change, researchers found. In Santa Clara County, Calif., for example, women\\'s binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012, compared with 23 percent among men. Nationwide over the course of the decade, the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men. Opinion: Why are more women drinking? \"It seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking,\" said Ali Mokdad, a lead author of the study. \"It\\'s really, really scary.\" The study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level. In 2012, 8 percent of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers. Despite the increases in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time, researchers found. Madison County, Idaho, reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012, at 6 percent, while Menominee, Wis., had the highest rate, at 36 percent. Hancock County, Tenn., had the fewest heavy drinkers (2 percent of residents) and Esmeralda County, Nev., recorded the most (22 percent). Related: 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink . About 88,600 U.S. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010, the researchers note, and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $220 billion per year. The increase in binge drinking doesn\\'t surprise Terri Fukagawa, clinical director of the New Life Recovery Centers in San Jose, Calif., where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol. She said she\\'s seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years. Still, she noted, \"there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment, but they won\\'t come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [getting] a DUI. They think they have control over it.\" Public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking. As a result of changed social norms, it\\'s now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have, said Tom Greenfield, scientific director at the Alcohol Research Group at the Oakland, Calif.-based Public Health Institute. Young people are more likely to binge drink, and affluent people have the money to drink more. So the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland -- many in hard-working, hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the Bay Area and similar communities, experts said. Taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the Consumer Price Index, so wine, beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars, he said. Alcohol advertising, particularly for hard liquor, has increased in recent years. A Federal Trade Commission study found that companies spent about $3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011. Alcohol control policies, such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open, have weakened in past decades, Greenfield said. That may partly explain rising consumption nationwide, particularly in some states where \"blue laws\" once prohibited alcohol sales on Sundays or in supermarkets. To conduct the study, researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

It\\'s hard to imagine the store\\'s founders in the late 1600\\'s could have imagined this kind of employee. That\\'s because the greeter is not a human -- it\\'s a robot. Aiko Chihira is an android manufactured by Toshiba, designed to look and move like a real person. It was put on temporary display at the department store. Toshiba says Chihira has 43 motors allowing it to move, speak in sign language and even sing. The regular greeter, Ayako Seiryu, says she\\'s not worried about a robot replacing her -- even one made to resemble a real 32-year-old woman. \"Communication is important,\" she says. \"My strength is I can actually talk to people.\" Chihira can\\'t have a conversation yet, acknowledges Hitoshi Tokuda, Toshiba spokesperson. But he says the technology is evolving quickly and someday, robots like Chihira could replace humans for certain jobs. A growing number of Japanese businesses are testing out robots as a possible solution to the country\\'s shrinking workforce. They\\'re appearing in stores, banks and soon even hotels. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ is trying out \"Nao,\" a customer service robot that answers basic questions and is designed to speak 19 languages. The robotic polygot could prove useful serving foreign customers during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. By then, the bank hopes to have even more robots on staff. \"Pepper\" is a humanoid robot that \"chats\" with customers. A humanoid has human-like characteristics such as arms, legs and a head -- but is designed to look like a robot. Pepper first began appearing in Tokyo stores last year. Manufacturer Softbank hopes it\\'ll eventually be a \"family robot,\" like a sleeker version of Rosie on \"The Jetsons.\" Meet Pepper -- the world\\'s first emo robot . A hotel scheduled to open at Huis Ten Bosch theme park in Nagasaki this summer plans to have 10 robot staff members and aims to increase that to more than 90% of hotel services operated by robots. Today\\'s novelty could be tomorrow\\'s necessity. Japan has an aging population that has prompted serious talks about how to incorporate robots into the nation\\'s shrinking workforce. One group that seems willing to embrace robots are Japan\\'s senior citizens. A survey by nursing home operator Orix Living found more seniors would feel comfortable being cared for by a robot than a foreign nurse. In a nation with a dwindling population, waning workforce, and deep resistance to immigration, it seems robots will only play a larger role in Japan\\'s future.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)About 20 hours after the Boston Marathon started Monday, many of the cheering crowds had dispersed and the streets were cleared. But one man, despite the odds against him, crossed the finish line. Venezuelan native Maickel Melamed, who is battling muscular dystrophy, completed the 26.2 miles just before 5 a.m. Tuesday. A group of energized fans rallied for the 39-year-old as he walked down Boylston Street in the pouring rain with volunteers from his foundation, Vamos. He was the last participant to complete the race, CNN affiliate WCVB-TV reported. Friends who were waiting for Melamed to cross the finish line said the university professor and motivational speaker is dedicated and motivated. \"He wants to show that life is great, no matter how many problems you can have,\" friend Perla Sananes said. Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy, which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body. As the disease progresses, people with the condition have difficulty doing physical activities like running and walking. Melamed has completed marathons in Chicago, New York, Berlin and Tokyo. Boston has a special place in his heart because his parents brought him to the city as a baby, WCVB-TV said. His perseverance was celebrated by crowds at the marathon finish line Tuesday morning, and also by fans online. Melamed is one of about 30,000 participants who raced in this year\\'s marathon, which comes less than two weeks after a jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 charges related to the 2013 Boston bombings. On social media Monday, spectators cheered for runners and the city, calling the marathon a symbol of strength and unity.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)C-SPAN\\'s live telecast of the White House Correspondents\\' Association dinner on Saturday night, hosted by Cecily Strong of \"Saturday Night Live,\" was not Strong\\'s finest hour, though the entire affair seemed like five of C-SPAN\\'s longest hours. Even so, there were some genuinely funny moments, although the ratio was low, and you had to be patient to get to them. But when you step back and look at the event as a whole, and appreciate what\\'s really happening -- in terms of press freedoms and even a U.S. president willing and able to poke fun at himself as well as others -- it\\'s hard not to think of this particular Beltway-meets-showbiz event as a wonderfully American exercise in tolerance and good humor. That being said, it\\'s a very tough room -- and not just because the Washington Hilton ballroom is so cavernous. More than 2,000 credentialed White House journalists and their mostly celebrity guests convened for the occasion. And convened, and convened, and convened, as time dragged on and dinner was served late. President Barack Obama, as Strong\\'s warm-up act, didn\\'t hit the podium until 10:20 p.m. (Strong got her turn at 10:45.) Obama, as in past years, came out strong -- a tough act to follow for any comedian. He had strong comedy lines and delivered them with timing that many stand-up comics would envy. Noting his lame-duck status, Obama said his advisers asked him if he had a bucket list. \"I have something that rhymes with bucket list,\" he claimed to have replied. Obama, noting the night\\'s guest speaker, said, \"On \\'Saturday Night Live,\\' Cecily impersonates CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin.\" Then, after a brief but well-timed pause, he added, \"Which is surprising, because usually, the only people impersonating journalists on CNN are journalists on CNN.\" Obama was nailing his own punch lines frequently, and perfectly. Then, to up the ante on his time at the podium, he welcomed his \"anger translator\" -- a recurring character played by Keegan-Michael Key on Comedy Central\\'s \"Key & Peele.\" It was a clever surprise, and the crowd reacted with surprising enthusiasm (I wouldn\\'t have presumed most of them knew of Key\\'s character or his series), though Key\\'s jokes lost something in the translation, and didn\\'t pack the punch of Obama\\'s. But the bit ended with a great twist: Obama himself getting so worked up about a snowball being carried into Congress to denounce global warming that the President\\'s \"anger translator\" had to calm Obama down instead. And then came Cecily Strong, with a sly opening line referring not only to her appearance as one of the few female guest speakers at the correspondents\\' dinner, but to the upcoming 2016 presidential election. \"Feels right,\" she said, \"to have a woman following President Obama.\" From there, the crowd seemed as tough as advertised, with \"oohs\" often as loud as laughter, as Strong went from one target to another. She even got \"oohs\" when her targets were outside the room, as when she said, noting how Obama has aged visibly in office, \"Your hair is so white now, it can talk back to the police.\" But the seemingly tepid response to Strong\\'s routine may have been partly due to the late hour. She came on after not only the dinner service and Obama, but after scholarship awards, correspondent awards and tributes and other bits of official business. And her routine wasn\\'t over until 11:08 p.m. -- making it a longer TV show than even the Emmys. Before the main event finally began, C-SPAN filled the time scanning the room with its cameras, but providing only ambient sound with very few identifying voice-overs or prerecorded features. Once in a while, you could see someone recognizable in the large, oddly eclectic crowd: Tea Leoni, Ivanka Trump, Larry Wilmore, Jane Pauley. For the most part, though, it was like playing a frustratingly difficult Beltway game of spot-the-face-in-the-crowd -- a sort of \"Who\\'s Waldo?\" And after a few hours watching a gaggle of people chat and eat, all I wanted to do was go home. And I was already home. But I stayed tuned, just so I could watch, and grade, the results. Final tally: Obama gets an A-,  Keegan-Michael Key a C, Cecily Strong a B-, and the entire telecast and event an A+ for democracy -- but a D as television.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)A New York jury deliberating the fate of the man charged with the 1979 killing of 6-year-old Etan Patz is struggling to reach a verdict. The little boy\\'s disappearance, more than three decades ago, sparked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children. Deliberations resumed on Thursday, one day after New York Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley ordered the jury to continue efforts to reach a decision on the guilt or innocence of a bodega worker named Pedro Hernandez. On the 10th day of deliberations, the jurors on Wednesday said in a note that they were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Hernandez confessed to police three years ago, but his lawyers said he made up his account of the crime. Etan Patz\\'s parents have waited more than 35 years for justice, but some have questioned whether that is even possible in Hernandez\\'s case. His lawyer has said that he is mentally challenged, severely mentally ill and unable to tell whether he committed the crime or not. Hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured Patz into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in Lower Manhattan. He said he killed the boy and threw his body away in a plastic bag. Neither the child nor his remains have ever been recovered. But Hernandez has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an \"IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range,\" his attorney Harvey Fishbein has said. Police interrogated Hernandez for 7½ hours before he confessed. \"I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz. But that doesn\\'t mean he actually did, and that\\'s the whole point of this case,\" Fishbein has said. But in November, a New York judge ruled that Hernandez\\'s confession and his waiving of his Miranda rights were legal, making the confession admissible in court. Hernandez is charged with two counts of second-degree murder for allegedly intending to cause the boy\\'s death and for a killing that occurred during a kidnapping. Another man\\'s name has also hung over the Patz case for years -- Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan\\'s babysitter. Etan\\'s parents, Stan and Julia Patz, sued Ramos in 2001. The boy was officially declared dead as part of that lawsuit. A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy\\'s death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million -- money the Patz family has never received. Though Ramos was at the center of investigations for years, he has never been charged. He served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and was set to be released in 2012. He was immediately rearrested upon leaving jail in 2012 on charges of failing to register as a sex offender, The Associated Press reported. Since their young son\\'s disappearance, the Patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the United States. In the early 1980s, Etan\\'s photo appeared on milk cartons across the country, and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children. \"It awakened America,\" said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. \"It was the beginning of a missing children\\'s movement.\" The actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it\\'s always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed, experts said. But the news industry was expanding to cable television, and sweet images of children appeared along with distraught parents begging for their safe return. The fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children\\'s Assistance Act, which led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. President Ronald Reagan opened the center in a White House ceremony in 1984. It soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)How would you get your nation\\'s president to hear you out? Put your name and number on a mango and hit him in the head with it? No? Then you\\'re not Marleni Olivo, who did exactly that, and in return is getting the new apartment she was asking for, said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Olivo, 54, saw her opportunity when Maduro visited Anzoategui, the state where she lives. Maduro, a former bus driver, drove a bus to a rally Wednesday where he was meeting with supporters. The president had the window open, the better to greet people attending the rally. Olivo had written a message on a mango -- \"If you can, call me,\" -- along with her name and phone number. She got as close as she could and, as the bus passed, she tossed the fruit at Maduro. In a video that has gone viral in Venezuela, Maduro is shown lowering his head when he is hit, just above the left ear. He then calmly picks up the mango and holds it up to the crowd. Later in the evening, the president mentioned the incident in one of his customary live TV broadcasts and displayed the infamous mango as proof. \"Marleni Olivo,\" Maduro said. \"We\\'re going to invite her to my [TV and radio] show, \\'In Touch with Maduro.\\' She had a housing problem, right? And, Marleni, I have approved it already, as part of the Great Housing Mission of Venezuela, you will get an apartment and it will be given to you in the next few hours. Tomorrow, no later than the day after tomorrow, we will give it to you.\" Maduro also joked that he had something in common with the mango. The word \"maduro\" in Spanish means ripe. Olivo told local media her intention was to toss the president a note, as others in the crowd were doing. \"I didn\\'t have paper available at that moment,\" she told El Pitazo TV. \"What I had was a mango that I was about to eat because I was hungry.\" Maduro\\'s critics are calling the incident a \"manguicidio,\" a play on the words \"mango\" and \"magnicidio,\" a Spanish word meaning assassination of a powerful leader. In Venezuela\\'s extremely polarized political climate, Maduro frequently talks about his belief that the opposition is conspiring to target him for assassination. But the mango-thrower says she had no evil intent. \"My dream is to own a home before I die,\" she told El Pitazo TV, adding that she had been very ill recently, that she suffers from diabetes and hypertension. And now her dream is about come true, a dream that would not have been possible without her boldness and a little help from a tasty mango.',\n",

The boat, named Airone, was intercepted some 90 kilometers (56 miles) from the Libyan port of Misrata, according to a statement from the Italian Joint Forces. An Italian naval unit boarded the fishing boat and took custody of a Libyan soldier on the vessel, according to a statement by the Italian Navy. It said during the operation, rifle shots were accidentally fired, and one of the seven fisherman on board was slightly injured. The Airone, carrying three Sicilians and four Tunisians, had embarked from Mazara del Vallo in Sicily five days earlier to fish for shrimp. The Airone\\'s captain said there were about 10 other ships in the area when it was seized, according to Vito Mazzarino, the boat\\'s owner. \"At a certain point a tug boat came up and flanked the fish boat and some Libyans came on board,\" Mazzarino said, quoting the captain, Alberto Figuccia. \"They were armed. And at that point chaos erupted.\" Italy is a major gateway to Europe for migrants from North Africa.

That incident occurred 60 nautical miles from the Libyan coast. The 250 migrants on board had already been transferred on to a different boat, Frontex said on its website. \"This is a sign that smugglers in Libya are running short of boats and are more willing to use weapons to recover those used to transport the migrants,\" said Fabrice Leggeri, Frontex\\'s executive director, in a news release.

The closed-door contest follows the postponements of Monday\\'s and Tuesday\\'s games against the White Sox until a doubleheader scheduled for May 28 following unrest in Baltimore. A source within Major League Baseball told CNN the league is not aware of any prior closed-door games in major league history. The game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards is scheduled to begin at 2:05 p.m. ET. The game will be televised on the MASN regional cable network. \"After conferring with local officials, it was determined that Wednesday afternoon\\'s game should be played without fan admittance in order to minimize safety concerns,\" Major League Baseball said. The office of new Commissioner Rob Manfred said the league and Orioles will keep an eye on the situation in Baltimore. \"Our thoughts are with all those who have been affected by violence in Baltimore, and everyone in our game hopes for peace and the safety of a great American city,\" Manfred said. Hall of Famer Frank Thomas tweeted that the series should be moved to a later date. The former White Sox star said, \"Playing in front of a empty house makes no sense!!\" The game changes come as the situation in the city remains tense following Monday\\'s riots, with more protests and arrests Tuesday. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said the closed game will mean \"another sad day in our city.\" \"We\\'re a sports town. We love our O\\'s,\" Rawlings-Blake told CNN\\'s Wolf Blitzer. The Orioles said tickets from Monday\\'s postponed game can be used for admittance on May 28. Fans with tickets for Tuesday\\'s game must exchange them for tickets for any remaining home game, including May 28. The team also announced it would move three games (May 1-3) against the Tampa Bay Rays to Florida. The Orioles will still be the home team, the team said. Fans with tickets for those games and Wednesday\\'s contest can swap their tickets for future games, based on the dollar amount of the ticket. Exchanges must be completed by June 30, the team said. The Orioles have averaged more than 33,000 fans in their first nine games at Camden Yards this season, about 73% of capacity. According to MLB.com, games have been postponed in the past because of security concerns. In 1992, four Los Angeles Dodgers games were pushed back because of riots after the acquittals of police officers in the Rodney King case. In 1967, riots in Detroit prompted baseball officials to move games between the Tigers and the Orioles to Baltimore. Opening Day of 1968 was postponed for two days after the killing of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, all professional baseball was called off for one week.

A U.S. defense official didn\\'t provide details about the attack in the city of Jalalabad. But an Afghan police chief told CNN that an Afghan National Army soldier shot at U.S. soldiers at a provincial governor\\'s compound in Jalalabad on Wednesday.

The incident was recorded by another woman with a smartphone camera across the street. Beatriz Paez filed a complaint Wednesday with police in South Gate, just south of Los Angeles. However, the police don\\'t have authority over marshals. Paez is also considering a lawsuit. Paez said she was out walking Sunday when she noticed what looked like an arrest several houses up the street. She stood on the sidewalk, recording with her phone. The woman said marshals asked her to stop recording but she told them she had a right to do so. The second woman who was recording had focused on the interaction between Paez and the marshals, who Paez said told her to stop recording. At one point on the video you can hear Paez say, \"You\\'re making me feel unsafe. I have a right to be here.\" Paez said she was a few homes away from the center of the police activity. In the video, an officer with a rifle walks in her direction. \"I was terrified. I was getting really scared,\" she said. As he gets close, the marshal then runs a few steps toward her and wrestles the phone from her hands. Paez said he stomped on it then kicked it away. It is unclear what happened to the video she recorded. The U.S. Marshals Service said it is reviewing the incident. Janice Hahn, the U.S. representative for Paez\\'s district, told CNN\\'s \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" that she had written a letter to outgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)This is a difficult but necessary thing to say: Incidents of police-involved killings and assaults on unarmed African-Americans are unlikely to end soon. That\\'s partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a \"moment.\" And it\\'s also because we have not yet shown the resolve needed to end it. This is a reality we must face if we are going to reverse course from what has become a national crisis. The peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in Baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis -- as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over. The violent response of police officers to unarmed African-Americans is a decades-long phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as \"race card\" politics and black grievance. But this year\\'s spate of killings and assaults, from Ferguson, Missouri, to North Charleston, South Carolina, to most recently Baltimore, are part of a deadly continuum of conduct that has created a well of resentment and anger in the  African-American community. So what makes now different? The advent of cell phone cameras and social media has for the first time allowed average citizens to document police brutality routinely and to disseminate these images nationally. As a result, it is no longer possible for officials and commentators to downplay or deny the existence of police brutality against unarmed African-Americans as has happened in the past. To call this ugly and unrelenting wave of police violence against unarmed African-Americans a national crisis is not an exaggeration -- we are losing the confidence of a generation of young people who no longer believe in the legitimacy or credibility of our law enforcement and the justice system that underpins it. A true democracy draws its strength from the confidence of its citizens in the bedrock institutions. The loss of that confidence threatens the very foundation of our legal system. How do we face this crisis? First, we must recognize that there are no quick fixes. The culture of policing in cities such as New York and Baltimore has developed over decades. Policing is a job passed down through families in which law enforcement norms and narratives are shared around the dinner table as much as in the station house. To subvert that culture will require vigorous, targeted and consistent training. That training must include a focus on managing implicit bias, encounters with the mentally ill and how best to de-escalate encounters with members of the community, especially young people. Training must be accompanied by supervision and accountability for officers who fail to conform their behavior to training principles. President Barack Obama is right when he reminds us that policing, like education, is a function of state and local government. And it\\'s true that his options are limited. And yet the federal government has proven to be quite adept at influencing education policy in states and cities. How? By conditioning federal funds on compliance with federal standards. In contrast, while the Department of Justice provides more than $1 billion annually in grants to police departments across the country, those funds are provided free from obligations that awardees adopt federal standards on training, data collection or other measures with an explicit anti-racial bias focus. That must change. Also, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department must be properly funded to investigate any police departments suspected of engaging in a pattern and practice of discrimination. Such investigations doubled to more than 20 under Attorney General Eric Holder, but given the nearly 30,000 police departments spread across the country, this is woefully inadequate. It\\'s been reported that nearly every investigation conducted by the department has resulted in a finding of a pattern and practice of discrimination. The results in places such as Seattle and Cincinnati, where the departments worked with local officials to negotiate changes to local police practices, are promising. But the $12 million currently allocated to these investigations nationwide is a shameful pittance. Much has been made of rogue police officers, \"bad apples\" and other aberrant actors in the criminal justice system. They undoubtedly exist. But the failure of local law enforcement leadership to vigorously and aggressively discipline, punish and, where appropriate, remove those officers from police forces around the country has allowed the bad apples to spoil the whole bunch. There must be zero tolerance for racism, brutality and corruption in police departments. Making this change will require law enforcement to value the integrity of the badge over the unquestioning solidarity that has too often resulted in the protection of officers who have committed egregious acts. Yet until police officers come to expect swift and certain punishment for violating their oath to protect and serve, we are unlikely to see a real decrease in incidents of racially motivated police brutality. Ultimately, the crisis we face presents an opportunity to rethink policing in this country fundamentally, including who we decide to recruit to serve. Former Baltimore Police Commissioner Leonard Hamm, for example, has told me he was always skeptical of new police recruits who expressed a desire to become narcotics or homicide detectives. That thinking reflects a spirit of adventure, he told me, rather than a spirit of service. Hamm is right -- policing is, at its core, a service profession. Those we select for this difficult and dangerous job should not only demonstrate mental toughness, courage and smarts, but also integrity, maturity, empathy and a commitment to the communities they serve. A national crisis requires a national response, and that means that federal, state and local law enforcement leaders and organizations must honestly and aggressively move to end police brutality. Until we see that kind of wholesale engagement, the lives of innocent people -- and the integrity of our legal system -- hangs in the balance.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Two Transportation Security Administration screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at Denver International Airport, Denver police said. Here\\'s how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger\\'s front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker . All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks . The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it\\'s unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim. The TSA said it has been trying to identify the passenger in the February incident but to no avail. The TSA said no passengers have come forward with similar cases so far at the Denver airport.

The cell phone video shows a number of men throwing punches and even chairs into crowds of people. Stanchions can be seen flying and being used as weapons in the chaotic scene. The fight took place in the food court area of Resorts World Casino where approximately 300 people were still at the scene when police arrived, according to the New York Police Department. One witness told CNN affiliate WCBS the scene was \"chaotic\" and compared it to a World Wrestling Entertainment event. The brawl took place in front of Fat Tuesday, which opened at the food court Friday. Police said that there was a drink special advertised at the casino. Several thousand dollars\\' worth of damages was done to the casino, police said, and an officer was taken to the hospital for a hand injury. Three men were arrestted in connection to the brawl, according to police. Two of the men were given a summons for disorderly conduct and released, while the third remains in custody and has been charged with obstructing governmental administration, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)There is a special kind of hell reserved for the women who fall into the clutches of today\\'s Jihadi fighters. We are all familiar with the brutality of ISIS, the self-anointed Islamic State, or Boko Haram, the Nigerian terrorists who have pledged allegiance to ISIS. This new wave of violent Islamist groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation. But there is something very different about the way they treat women. The jihadi chiefs have a strategy beyond the battlefield. Their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy. Killing the enemy, the men, is a tactic for winning battles and conquering territory. What they do to women has an altogether different purpose: It is part of the larger plan of building a \"caliphate,\" a Sharia-ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or, rather, to the group\\'s interpretation of life in the early days of Islam. Yazidi girls who slipped ISIS after its siege of Mount Sinjar describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women. There, they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for ISIS fighters to choose among them, some for marriage, others for sexual slavery. The stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault. An investigation by Human Rights Watch found  \"a system of organized rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery, and forced marriage by ISIS forces,\" actions that the group says \"are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity.\" In Nigeria, Boko Haram also has a very specific approach to women. The 276 students kidnapped one year ago make up a small portion of the 2,000 women and girls kidnapped by the group since 2014, according to  Amnesty International. There, too, women captives move from house to house and village to village, forced to convert when they are not Muslim, and prepare for marriage to jihadis. It\\'s a stark change from the previous generation of jihadis, when Osama bin Laden headed al Qaeda. Women were not a big part of al Qaeda\\'s immediate plans because al Qaeda, unlike ISIS, viewed the establishment of a caliphate as a distant goal, one for future generations. In contrast, ISIS is actively engaged in building those social structures. And if you want to build a new society, you need more than soldiers. You also need women. Women are indispensable for establishing a functioning community, even one whose laws are brutally repressive. Even if women are viewed as the property of men, they are still needed, not just for cooking, cleaning and sex, but to keep the home and raise children; hence the methodical capture, assault and subjugation. It is no accident that Boko Haram has targeted students, as it did in Chibok, or that Somalia\\'s Al-Shabaab Islamists killed scores of women in the massacre at Kenya\\'s Garissa University in Kenya. As in previous conflicts, women are spoils of war and rape is a weapon of war. It is a way to humiliate the enemy, a \"reward\" for soldiers and a tactic of ethnic cleansing. During the Bosnian war of the 1990s, experts said Serbian soldiers engaged in systematic rape, thinking the babies of raped Bosnian Muslim women would be Serbian. In Darfur, government-backed militias were accused of using mass rape to humiliate the non-Arab groups. But this is different. The women are not simply abused and discarded. ISIS and Boko Haram are enslaving them and incorporating them into the daily life of territories they rule, subjecting them to asphyxiating restrictions and abuses that have caused many of them to attempt suicide, according to some of those who escaped -- a phenomenon reminiscent of Afghanistan during the rule of the Taliban, another radical Islamic group that managed to take control and impose unspeakable rules for women. ISIS is going to great lengths to prove how its treatment of women, including the selling of Yazidi prisoners as slaves, is in keeping with Islamic law. Its online magazine cites Islamic writings proclaiming: \"We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah.\" The worst fate is reserved for non-Muslims, such as Yazidis, but Muslim women in areas seized by Islamists have seen disaster. From Mosul, Iraq\\'s second-largest city, a modern town until ISIS conquered it last year, women say, \"They have withheld all freedoms from us\" and describe oppressive, fear-filled lives. The brutality of the new jihadis is more than mere sadism. If it is madness, it is madness with a method. And when it comes to women, the method is one that aims to control them as a way to establish the society they envision, one where some women say life is simply not worth living.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Monday night, as unrest raged across Baltimore\\'s streets, Amanda Rothschild lay awake in her Remington home, a neighborhood in the northern part of the city, thinking about what the next day would be like. As a co-owner of Charmington\\'s, a cafe in the intersection of three major Baltimore neighborhoods, Rothschild knew that the cafe and its workers needed to support the city after all the unrest. \"There was some fear, but it was really mixed in with an overwhelming sense that everyone here needs help,\" she said. As protests erupt nationwide after the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody, some local businesses in Baltimore are banding together to show their support for the city, while others are left to rebuild or repair after Monday\\'s riot. Late Monday evening over email, Rothschild  and other workers from Charmington\\'s decided that the cafe would remain closed on Tuesday so that staff members could spend the day in the community to help clean up or peacefully protest. 45 CVS workers still getting paid after riots shut down stores . The following morning, they posted a sign on the door telling patrons they were closed to partake in community action (The cafe was not in Monday\\'s protest zone). \"We shut down not out of fear, but for solidarity,\" Rothschild said. It was solidarity for Baltimore, for the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement and for the local businesses that were destroyed during the rioting, the five-year Baltimore resident explained. With a warm, steaming crock pot of chicken and a cooler of ice water, Charmington\\'s staff member Mike Dobson made his way down to the center of the rallying Tuesday and set up a stand. It was one of a handful of businesses passing out free food and water to protesters. The movement in Baltimore is personal for Dobson. The 23-year-old has been out on the streets peacefully demonstrating and offering free food every day since protests first started. \"I have witnessed police brutality. I was roughed up by police before. It is something you don\\'t have to look very far to witness in West Baltimore,\" he said. The decision for Charmington\\'s to close temporarily -- it has since reopened -- was meaningful, Dobson said. \"Our shop has been a part of the community since it opened, and we thought it was important to be a part of the community especially now.\" The feeling on Baltimore\\'s streets has changed dramatically over the past few days. It\\'s now peaceful and somewhat celebratory, Dobson said. \"There have been protests, but there have also been celebrations of all us together, and you can\\'t have a celebration without food,\" he said. Not all businesses fared well. Some suffered major losses. Trevira London\\'s store London Couture Boutique on Fleet Street was ransacked Monday. Her windows were smashed and her merchandised looted. \"They wiped me out,\" the 36-year-old said. She understands the frustration and can see why some local businesses are joining the movement to stand with their city, but she\\'s also depressed that her business, one that she opened only four months ago, was destroyed in the wake of the unrest. And there are reports that the weeklong curfew is affecting smaller businesses. \"This is not a black or white issue. This has been going on decades. But there are ways to protest without hurting people, destroying buildings and looting,\" London said. In the meantime, she is thinking about boarding up her storefront just to be safe. Other businesses outside the major protest zones stayed open to be a resource for the community this past week. John Duda, an owner and worker at the cooperative restaurant and bookstore Red Emma\\'s, decided to stay open after the upheaval on Monday. When  workers heard that schools were going to be closed Tuesday, they felt the need to keep their door opens in order to provide free meals to students and those who are the most vulnerable in the city. \"We saw it on social media that people were trying to figure out how to feed school children who depend on school lunches and we thought we could stand in solidarity with folks,\" the 37-year-old said. The response was incredible, he said. Not only were students coming in for free lunches, but Baltimore residents were coming by to see whether they could volunteer and offer their support. \"I was initially a little concerned that the reaction and the unrest on Monday would take away from important issues facing the city,\" Duda said. But he has seen residents of the city step up to show their support for not only Freddie Gray, but the need to address social and economic disparities in the city. It has inspired the 12-year Baltimore resident and business owner to start peacefully protesting as well. On Wednesday, with the sun setting in the background, Duda marched with a group down the streets of Baltimore. The scene was beautiful, Duda said. Red Emma\\'s is normally closed during the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, with the exception of having to close an hour early this Friday and Saturday. Charmington\\'s is not normally open during the curfew hours. Duda said many of the people marching weren\\'t just marching for Freddie Gray; they were also marching for better education and work opportunities. Duda said these people have been voicing their frustrations for years, but it seems like now they are finally being heard. \"It took the city to almost tear itself apart for it to start coming together.\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Launching rockets is a complicated thing. Landing them upright on a platform floating in the ocean? Well, that\\'s never been done before. SpaceX, the private space exploration company founded by billionaire Elon Musk, hopes to give it a try. But weather forced it to scrub Monday\\'s plan to launch. SpaceX said on Twitter that Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET will be the next opportunity for the company to launch a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That will be the easy part. After the launch, SpaceX will try to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform, or what it calls an autonomous spaceport drone ship, in the Atlantic Ocean off Florida. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth\\'s atmosphere or, like NASA\\'s space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company\\'s website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to \"reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\" SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. The company has previously said the odds of a successful landing are about 50%. If you want to see how it goes, it will post photos online throughout the mission and will put video on YouTube. And if the landing doesn\\'t work? SpaceX says it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth\\'s atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They\\'ll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they\\'re done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. CNN\\'s Catherine E.

Officer Michael Rapiejko ran his car into Mario Valencia in February as the suspect carried a rifle he had just fired in the air. Rapiejko sped around another officer as Valencia walked through a business park, hit the man from behind with the left side of his front bumper. Valencia, who flew through this air, survived and faces more than a dozen charges for an alleged crime spree that day. His lawyer has said police used excessive force and could have killed a man who was obviously unstable. The Marana Police Department has defended Rapiejko, saying deadly force was warranted because the suspect had a rifle, ammunition and was walking toward offices where hundreds of people work. Marana is just northwest of Tucson. Officer who drove into suspect justified, chief says . KVOA obtained police inquiry tapes on which Rapiejko tells investigators why he chose his car as a weapon. The officer, who has been a cop for more than a decade but joined the Marana Police Department in 2014, said he was 50 yards away from the suspect and worried a missed shot might hit another officer or bystanders. \"There were occupied businesses, and there were two officers at the other side of the street,\" he says on the recording. \"This is what I deem as a lethal force encounter. I have two thoughts that go in my mind: I need to shoot him to stop the threat, or I need to run him over to stop the threat.\" Another officer, who was slowing trailing Valencia and ahead of Rapiejko, says on another recording that if a civilian had stumbled upon Valencia, the suspect might have taken a hostage or killed the person.

The investigation began Wednesday when the 4-month-old infant of the 17-year-old was taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in suburban Las Vegas, authorities said. Police arrested the teen mother on one count of child abuse with substantial bodily harm. She was taken to a juvenile facility. Police department spokesman Aaron Patty told CNN affiliate KVVU that the \"infant did not receive the proper care and nourishment that she needed at the time, which is what led to the arrest of the 17-year-old.\" A day later, a search warrant was served at the family\\'s home. That\\'s when police found the body of the 3-year-old girl, who had apparently been dead \"for at least a few weeks,\" according to police. The teen mother was then arrested on one count of child abuse with death in connection with her younger sister\\'s death, according to a police statement. The parents left the home several months ago with the other five children, ranging in age from 1 to 9 years old, but, according to Patty, \"they left the 3-year-old child and the 17-year-old sister at the residence alone.\" Authorities are seeking the parents, 39-year-old Jondrew Lachaux and 38-year-old Kellie Phillips. Police say the five children with them may be in danger. \"We believe that they went to California at some time and may have gone back and forth during this multiple month process when they left,\" Patty said.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)The Arizona police officer who intentionally slammed his car into an armed suspect previously faced an excessive force lawsuit in New York, according to court documents. Officer Michael Rapiejko was with the New York Police Department from 2003 to 2006. Two years after he left, he was one of the defendants in a suit filed by a man who alleged that Rapiejko pointed a gun and threatened to shoot him and handcuffed and choked him in front of his family during a 2005 arrest. The lawsuit said Luis Colon had parked his car and gotten out when Rapiejko, with his gun aimed at Colon, ordered him back into the car. During his arrest on charges of obstructing governmental administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, Colon alleged he was yanked from the car, handcuffed and choked. The charges against Colon were dropped six months later. Colon also sued two unnamed officers who arrived after the initial confrontation, court documents show. Colon and the city settled the suit for $20,000. The settlement said the defendants were not admitting to any wrongdoing . Rapiejko had resigned voluntarily in 2006, and there is no indication of any disciplinary action against him from the NYPD, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. The NYPD has said that it will not release further details about Rapiejko. Rapiejko\\'s actions in Marana, Arizona, in which he drove his patrol car into a man who had fired a rifle in the air minutes earlier and before that had pointed the gun at another officer, have stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer for the February incident. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN\\'s \"New Day\" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn\\'t die. \"That very well may be ... that it\\'s luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,\" Rozema said. \"So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that\\'s unfortunate, (but) that\\'s not the desire of everybody,\" the chief added. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a nearby Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Rapiejko\\'s camera shows the officer\\'s vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko\\'s actions. \"We don\\'t know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn\\'t take somebody out in the parking lot,\" Rozema said. \"And then we\\'re answering some completely different questions: \\'Why didn\\'t you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn\\'t you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?\\' \" Valencia\\'s attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that \"it is miraculous that my client isn\\'t dead.\" \"Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force,\" Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several crimes there the day he was struck, including a stealing a car that he drove a half hour north to Marana. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Two pieces of audio recorded in the immediate aftermath of a deadly police shooting in South Carolina emerged Monday. The voice of Michael Slager can be heard in both. The former North Charleston police officer is charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. In the first recording, an unidentified officer talks to Slager about what might happen. \"Once they get here, it\\'ll be real quick. They\\'re gonna tell you, you\\'re gonna be off for a couple days and we\\'ll come back and interview you then. They\\'re not gonna ask you any type of questions right now. They\\'re gonna take your weapon,\" the officer says. \"It\\'d probably be a good idea to jot down your thoughts about whatever happened ... once the adrenaline stops pumping.\" Slager responds: \"It\\'s pumping,\" and then laughs. The second audio, taken from dash cam video from inside a patrol car, captures a phone call between Slager and someone CNN believes is his wife. He tells her: \"Hey. Hey, everything\\'s OK. OK? I just shot somebody.\" \"He grabbed my Taser, yeah. Yeah,\" says Slager. \"He was running from me. ... I\\'m fine.\" If convicted of murder, the former officer faces up to life in prison or the death penalty, although a death penalty case appears unlikely at this point. \"Based on the facts revealed thus far, it does not appear South Carolina\\'s death penalty provision applies in this case because there are no statutory \\'aggravating circumstances\\' present,\" Scarlett A. Wilson, who is the chief prosecutor for the Ninth Judicial Circuit in the state, said on her Facebook page. Slager was charged after cell phone video emerged, showing him firing at Scott as the man ran away. Who was Walter Scott? Pierre Fulton was riding in a car with Scott before the shooting took place. \"Walter was a dear friend and I miss him every day,\" Fulton said in a statement given to ABC News by his lawyer.  \"Over the past five years he helped me to become a better man and showed me the value of hard work.\" \"I\\'ll never know why he ran, but I know he didn\\'t deserve to die,\" Fulton said.  \"Please keep Walter and his family in your prayers and respect my privacy moving forward.\" Scott\\'s passenger meets with police . Scott\\'s death has reignited a national conversation around race and policing. Scott was black; Slager is white. The case has also brought to light previous instances in which Slager\\'s behavior on the job is being questioned. On Monday, attorneys for a man named Julius Wilson announced that they were filing a lawsuit in connection with an August 2014 traffic stop. During the stop, three officers -- including Slager -- pulled Wilson out of his car. Wilson was then allegedly shocked with a stun gun. The suit claims Slager used excessive force. Slager was also named in a police complaint in 2013 after he allegedly \"Tased a man for no reason\" before slamming him to the ground and dragging him, according to the North Charleston Police Department. At the time, Slager was searching for a suspect who was described as being 5-feet-5-inches tall. The African-American man he confronted was 6-feet-3 inches tall. A lawyer for Mario Givens, the man who filed the complaint, said last week that his client plans to file a lawsuit. Givens said Slager came to his door, ordered him out of the house and then Tased him. Slager was later cleared in that incident. What we know about Officer Slager .

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)As Nepal grapples with an earthquake that has killed more than 3,400 people, Ronen Ziv worries about someone he has never met. His unborn baby is due this week in Kathmandu. He had tickets to travel to Nepal for his child\\'s birth from a surrogate mother, but now he has no choice but to wait in his native Israel for news. \"It\\'s terrifying,\" Ziv said. \"I can tell you I didn\\'t get much sleep ...  all my thoughts and all my prayers are for the surrogate mother and the unborn child.\" Nepal is a popular place for Israeli couples to have surrogate children. Ziv\\'s first child, a 15-month-old daughter, was born to a surrogate mother in Nepal. Ziv and his partner, Tom, traveled to Nepal for the birth. They were planning on making the trip once again, but the earthquake forced them to change their plans. Companies that help arrange surrogate pregnancies estimate 25 couples are now in Kathmandu with newborn surrogate children, while 10 to 15 surrogate mothers are due to give birth in the coming weeks. The country is also a popular spot for Israeli travelers. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates there are about 600 to 700 Israelis in Nepal. Israel Defense Forces is sending 260 emergency responders to Nepal, including search-and-rescue teams. The group is also bringing almost 100 tons of medical aid supplies. Ziv says his baby is in a breech position, requiring a cesarean section. In the current chaos of Kathmandu, he worries his surrogate mother, Nafisa Shaje, will not get the proper medical attention required for a safe and healthy birth. Ziv would prefer Shaje fly to Israel, where hospitals can provide the needed medical help. But with only days left until the baby is due, Ziv said putting Shaje on a plane might not be possible. \"If anything else happens, it could very quickly go to absolute catastrophe,\" Ziv says. Hospitals in Nepal have been flooded with injured quake victims. Some have been turned away so doctors can tend to the most severely injured. Cila Tamir, Ziv\\'s attorney, has been working with the Ministry of the Interior to try to bring Shaje to Israel. \"She has no place to deliver. No conditions,\" Tamir said. \"Everything is ruined there, and I\\'m sure that the hospital doesn\\'t function normally because of the casualties and the injuries.\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)The marriage apocalypse may be coming. Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free, with everyone happily single. I did. And I do. Recently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. \\'Cause, guess what? They don\\'t care what your generation thinks -- they\\'ll get married if and when they want. \"I didn\\'t go to college for four years to be a mom,\" 21-year old Candace Monacelli told me. \"There\\'s no housewife degree. I\\'ve worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well.\" Jackie Demate, also 21, agreed. \"I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe.\" At first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, \"Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!\" Jackie didn\\'t blink. \"But, Europe!\" she exclaimed. \"I\\'m really looking for a travel buddy. And I don\\'t think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I\\'m not happy. ... I\\'m OK being single forever. As long as I\\'m happy.\" Before you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she\\'s coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once. That\\'s up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960. What a fine example my generation is! Not. Still, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage. When asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children, 50% of respondents were OK with that. And of that 50%, 66% were adults between 18 and 29. Religious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons. Economists are concerned for our collective future. Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction. A study sponsored by the conservative American Enterprise Institute says:  \"From an obvious standpoint, households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes, improving well-being.\" On the other hand, the study points out, people who have money may be \"more desirable marriage prospects.\" Bingo on that point. The millennials I talked with prefer their partners to be debt-free and riding high. They also don\\'t want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt. \"Right now, I\\'m 21 years old. And I\\'m thousands of dollars in debt,\" Emily Crille told me. \"That wasn\\'t something my parents bore. And it\\'s really hard to plan a wedding, or even think about something like that when you owe so much money, you don\\'t have a job, and you don\\'t have a home.\" I felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes. As a child of divorce I never wanted to get married, either -- until I met my husband at 38. But, when I was in my twenties, waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority. I heard the whispers: Is there something wrong with her? Is she selfish? Unlovable? Perhaps it is selfish to establish a career, travel and have a child on your own. Or, maybe it\\'s exactly right. Scandinavians are just about there. According to USA Today: \"In Norway ... 82% of couples have their first child out of wedlock. The numbers are similarly high for Sweden and Denmark. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it\\'s clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying.\" The article also points out that \"Norway ranked first and Sweden second in the United Nations\\' quality-of-life survey for 2004, which rates per capita income, education levels, health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation\\'s well-being. The USA came in eighth.\" In an effort to understand the joys of \"sambo,\" the term for living together in Scandinavia, my producer reached out to Mikael Anteskog Adler, a 35-year-old man from Stockholm, Sweden. \"To put it short,\" he told us, \"marriage costs money (party, clothes, rings, honeymoon trip, etc.) and gives no significant advantages, as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married, or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation.\" Wow. Fifty-year-old Anne Lehes, from Gothenburg, Sweden, told my producer, \"I believe that one reason for many Swedes staying single is because this is a secular country, so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner, and inevitably they get disappointed and then they don\\'t think the whole thing is worth it.\" Maybe Christina Hugosson of Uppsala, Sweden, sums it up best: \"The notion that marriage is something that you\\'re pressured into seems horrible to me. ... Marriage should be for love, not a matter of expectations, routine and everyday practicalities.\" My Kent State millennials -- true romantics -- would agree wholeheartedly with Hugossan. Emily told me as much, \"Marriage is about love. It\\'s not about planning or timing, and that\\'s what we\\'re all kind of waiting for.\" Marriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. And, as they say, sometimes love isn\\'t enough. Which brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse. Would it be so terrible if we all remained single? If I had remained single? I thought about it. So did my husband. We didn\\'t plan to have children, what was the point? In the end, we made a decision based on love and practicality. A commitment would not only prove our love, but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure. Eleven years later we have no regrets. But, we are not you and yours. Would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with \"I dos\"? I don\\'t know. But I would love to know if you do.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)For five decades, Bikram Choudhury built an empire. The signature \"hot yoga\" bearing his name drew throngs of devotees, spawning studios teaching the practice all over the world. He became a spiritual leader and celebrity icon with a long list of famous followers and friends. But now, the Bikram brand is in jeopardy, with some yoga studios dropping his name after the guru was accused of rape or sexual assault by six of his former students. Responding to the allegations for the first time in an exclusive interview with CNN, Choudhury said he wanted to set the record straight. \"I want to show you,\" he said, \"tell the truth to the world, that I never assaulted them.\" Choudhury repeatedly denied sexually assaulting anyone, saying he would never resort to physical aggression to have sex because he has so many offers. \"Women like me. Women love me,\" he said. \"So if I really wanted to involve the women, I don\\'t have to assault the women.\" He said he feels sorry for his accusers, claiming they\\'ve been manipulated by lawyers to lie. \"I have nothing against them. I don\\'t think they\\'re bad people. It\\'s not them saying that,\" he said. \"They are influenced by somebody.\" But Choudhury\\'s accusers say he\\'s the one who\\'s been lying. \"This stuff that he\\'s teaching is really good stuff, but he\\'s hurting people and hiding behind this good stuff so people don\\'t believe he\\'s capable of hurting people,\" said Sarah Baughn, a former student who now accuses Choudhury of sexual assault. \"He\\'s got to stop lying behind it. And he\\'s got to stop doing this to people.\" Choudhury is the founder of Bikram\\'s Yoga College of India. He\\'s featured prominently on its website, which details his system of performing 26 unique yoga poses while in a very hot room. With studios heated to 105 degrees, he credits the steamy, sweaty stretches with transforming people\\'s bodies and minds. He said he\\'s guided by a deep calling to help others. Civil lawsuits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court tell the story of a different Bikram Choudhury, describing him as someone who preyed on young women who looked to him for guidance. Besides Baughn\\'s claim of sexual assault, five other women have come forward with civil lawsuits claiming Choudhury raped them. The Los Angeles Police Department, without explanation, declined to pursue criminal charges in the cases. At first, Baughn said, she felt Bikram Yoga would be the answer to her years of back pain and depression. \"It was really quite life-changing for me. ... I felt good for the first time in a while,\" she said, describing her first class. Baughn said her father helped her take out a $7,000 loan so she could attend Bikram\\'s teacher training. But within the first week, she said, one episode left her feeling uncomfortable. In a meeting in Choudhury\\'s office, she said, the guru seemed to make an advance. \"He said, \\'What should we do about us? We need to make this a relationship. ... I\\'ve known you from a past life.\\' It was instantly shocking. I felt like my whole system just sort of imploded,\" she said. Then, she said, Choudhury cornered her late one night, making it clear she had to sleep with him in order to advance her career. \"He crawled on top of me and he put his hand on my, inside of my thigh, and the other hand he wrapped around me, and he was holding me there,\" she said. \"He told me that he needed somebody to be with him, to massage him, to brush his hair, to spend time with him, that he was lonely. And he said, \\'And I need someone to, to have sex with me.\\'\" Choudhury, she said, claimed she\\'d never win a yoga competition if he didn\\'t have sex with her. \"I pushed him off of me and I said, \\'I can do this by myself.\\' And he said, \\'No you can\\'t. There\\'s no way.\\' And I got up and I left the room,\" she said. In another instance, she said Choudhury pinned her against a door and sexually assaulted her when she was left alone with him late one night at a teacher training course. \"I just remember I was terrified. I didn\\'t want to be touched again. When I reached the door, he was there,\" she said. \"He was only in his boxers and a T-shirt. And he pushed himself up against me and held me up against the door,\" she said. \"And he just started kissing all over my chest and my body. And he pushed himself into me very hard.\" Ultimately, Baughn said she was able to open the door and get away. Choudhury said Baughn\\'s claims are false. \"It\\'s not truth. I don\\'t do that. I don\\'t have to,\" he said. He said he makes it a practice to never be alone with any of his students. He repeatedly denied assaulting his accusers or ever having consensual sex with them. But when asked whether he\\'d had sex with other students, he responded, \"yes and no.\" \"I have no intention to have sex with any of my students or any women,\" said Choudhury, who said he\\'s been married to his wife for more than 30 years. \"Sometimes students, they commit suicide. Lots of students of mine, they commit suicide because I will not have sex with them.\" Bikram claimed these encounters took place before he was married.  But when asked for evidence, Bikram\\'s attorney advised him not to give CNN names. Robert Tafoya, Choudhury\\'s attorney, said there are plenty of reasons to doubt the accusers\\' claims. \"We know for a fact that these claims allegedly occurred years and years and years ago, and nobody ever came forward,\" he said. \"And yet, after this lawyer sends out these kinds of blasts in social media asking people if they\\'ve been a victim of Bikram Choudhury, all of a sudden these people come forward and all have very similar claims.\" Carney Shegerian, Baughn\\'s attorney, said that\\'s simply not true. When Baughn started telling her story, he said, others were inspired to speak out. \"When she came forward and went public, it attracted other people, and the other five plaintiffs to also have a modicum of confidence to discuss what had happened to them,\" he said. Baughn said she was inspired by her young daughter to come forward when she did. \"She\\'s 5 now, 5½. But when I looked at my little girl and all I could see was 10 years down the road, or 20 years down the road, and her being just like me, the only thing I could see was her getting raped and assaulted,\" she said. Choudhury vowed to clear his name. But he said the damage has already been done to his family. He cries as he describes how his wife has responded to the allegations against him. \"My wife never look at me anymore,\" he said. \"My children, my wife ... we only die once in our life. I\\'m dying every day when I get up in the morning.\" The situation, he said, has destroyed his family. \"How can I share my heart, my spirit? Twenty-four hours a day, I work harder than any other human being. And this is the reward? I\\'m a rapist?\" he said. \"Shame on your culture, Western culture. Shame, shame. Your job (is) to go and tell the world the truth.\" CNN\\'s  Catherine E. Shoichet, Dana Ford and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)It has all the key points you\\'d expect on a birth certificate -- baby\\'s weight, length and date of birth confirmed with an official insignia. The difference here is the governing authority\\'s stamp: The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. It\\'s one of many official documents relating to matters such as vaccination schedules, fishing methods and rent disputes in the areas now controlled by ISIS. For ISIS sees itself as a government operating under a rule of law, even if the group is most often talked about for its barbaric punishment of anyone who resists or defies its medieval interpretation of that Islamic law. The ISIS documents, some shared with CNN by researcher Aymenn Al-Tamimi, give a window into the bureaucracy of the self-declared caliphate. Last summer, ISIS fighters swept through the Iraqi city of Mosul. Once they took power, leaders wanted to show they could bring stability allowing daily life to resume. So, they quickly reopened the University of Mosul, albeit under a radically altered curriculum. Notices went out that classes would resume on 24 Dhu al-Hijjah 1435 in the Islamic calendar (or October 18, 2014, in the Western calendar), about four months after ISIS overran the city. But some subjects would be banned -- democracy and political thought, also hotel management and tourism and archaeology. Families flee ISIS in Iraq . \"The banning of archaeology is not a surprise,\" says Al-Tamimi, who is a Shillman-Ginsburg Fellow at the Middle East Forum at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, in Israel. \"We see that reflected in ISIS destruction of ancient artifacts. ISIS regards pre-Islamic artifacts as relics from the \\'period of ignorance\\', jahiliyah. Their main concern with archaeology is that it would become a subject turning to idol worship, which is strictly forbidden in Islam. \"Hotel management and tourism may seem strange as first. But there are no hotels under ISIS. They have all been taken over and shut down, either rented out or become places to house families.\" Mosul University still has the same professors and teachers, Al-Tamimi says. \"But now teachers are subjected to Sharia sessions, to learn what is and what is not acceptable to ISIS. So, they have preserved the prior system but within ISIS Sharia law conditions.\" The ISIS Health Department runs hospitals for anyone feeling ill, not just wounded fighters. It has maternity wards, health clinics, even a mobile vaccination unit. And while an ancient interpretation of religion remains at the heart of rules, there is more nuance than was seen in Afghanistan and areas still controlled by the Taliban. \"This is one thing that distinguishes ISIS from groups like the Taliban, which forbids vaccinations.  Polio is a problem in Pakistan because the Taliban believes the vaccines are a forbidden substance.  But ISIS is not that primitive,\" says Al-Tamimi. \"This is also reflected in education:  The Taliban, forbids all girls\\' education. But ISIS allows girls to go to school, albeit in a segregated environment.\" However, education for girls is limited to the age of 15. Reporting from areas controlled by ISIS is near impossible but anecdotes of daily life and death do emerge. Al-Tamimi\\'s conclusions on ISIS\\'s governing principles and methods follow similar findings by the Quilliam Foundation, other researchers and social activists. How ISIS makes (and takes) money . It is an Islamic principle to care for the environment, so that\\'s one reason that using explosives to catch fish is banned. And a quote from the Quran saying property owners should lessen the burden on renters to earn spiritual rewards is used at the start of a document outlining a policy on rent control. \"A general theme for ISIS is that they try, initially when they seize control, to portray themselves as more just, more fair to the inhabitants than the previous ruler,\" explains Al-Tamimi. \"For example, in Syria, the first thing ISIS did was lower the price of bread. This is as much about winning over the population as it is about religious rulings.\" At times, such as taking up the case of renters, the regime can seem almost benevolent, Al-Tamimi says. \"If someone does complain, especially in Syria, ISIS does actually try to deal with it,\" he says. \"That\\'s why they\\'ve been seen by many in Syria as imposing order, especially in areas where multiple parties, rebel factions and the Syrian government were previously in control.\" ISIS control of its territory is absolute -- bus schedules show routes from Raqqa to Mosul and Qaim with no acknowledgment of the Syria-Iraq border, just the new provinces created by the group for its territory. Detained ISIS members speak from Iraqi jail . And inside that territory, even entertainment is regulated. Foosball can be played, provided there is no gambling and the faces or heads are taken off the figurines to prevent idol worship. A fatwa on entertainment goes on to say that chess, billiards and other \"contemporary games\" do not benefit Muslims but may be played if they do not distract from religious obligations.  It reaches that conclusion from the Quran and other religious teachings. That\\'s also part of ISIS strategy, says Al-Tamimi. \"One of ISIS\\'s goals is to present this very religiously learned image, showcasing their knowledge of Islamic jurisprudence to justify to their following that they are the moral authority.  It\\'s clear that ISIS and their religious clerics and scholars are extremely familiar with religious texts and use them to convince and persuade ISIS followers, which also makes them impervious to any religion-based counterargument.\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)This week brought a dramatic turn of events in a small community outside of Detroit: A man bloodied during a traffic stop was cleared of all charges, the police officer who arrested the motorist is charged with beating him and the community\\'s police chief has stepped down. On Monday, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced charges of assault and mistreatment of a prisoner against William Melendez. He\\'s the 49-year-old former Inkster, Michigan, police officer who is seen in police car dashcam video grabbing the unarmed motorist, Floyd Dent, around the neck while he lay on the ground and punching him several times in the head. \"The alleged police brutality in this case cannot and will not be tolerated,\" Worthy said. On Wednesday, drug charges against Dent, 57, were formally dropped in Michigan Circuit Court, clearing the motorist of all wrongdoing. \"He busted out crying and was very emotional,\" said Angela Martin, the assistant to Dent\\'s attorney. In the wake of the reversal of fates, Police Chief Vicki Yost announced Wednesday her resignation, according to Inkster City Manager Richard Marsh. Marsh would not cite a specific reason for Yost\\'s investigation, though she had been the face of the Police Department during the investigation into her former officer. In a statement, Dent and his attorney Greg Rohl told CNN: \"We are all ecstatic, especially Mr. Dent. This is another step in the right direction. The system is still working, and we are very hopeful the prosecutor\\'s net will catch even more fish in the near future.\" Yost did not respond to a request for comment. Dent, a veteran Ford automotive worker, was arrested after the January traffic stop on charges of drug possession, assaulting an officer and resisting arrest. With the court decision Wednesday, all charges from the arrest have been dropped. Melendez pleaded not guilty to the new charges brought against him in an arraignment Tuesday at Inkster District Court, according to his lawyer, David Lee. \"We intend to vigorously contest the charges,\" Lee said. \"I can understand how people might be disturbed by looking at [the video]; however; I hope everyone will withhold judgment until all the facts come out where they should in a court of law.\" Worthy\\'s announcement came after the conclusion of two investigations into the incident by Michigan State Police and the Wayne County Prosecutor\\'s Office. In the police report written after the January arrest, Melendez wrote that he hit Dent only after Dent had threatened him and bit him in the arm. Melendez wrote that as he approached the car, Dent kept his hands from view, looked at him \"with a blank stare as if on a form of narcotic,\" and said, \"I\\'ll kill you.\" Dent told CNN at the time that he had never threatened nor bit the police officer. \"I didn\\'t bite anyone. I didn\\'t have time to bite anyone. He was too busy pounding me in my head,\" Dent said. Rohl also alleged that the cocaine found at the scene had been planted by Melendez. \"My client\\'s fingerprints will not be on that bag,\" Rohl told WDIV.',\n",

Perhaps the great jazz and rock music scene in Denmark is for you? It\\'s not just the fun activities that make locals and travelers to those countries happy, according to the third World Happiness Report, released by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations on April 23. People who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies and more social support, experience more generosity, have more freedom to make life choices, have lower perceptions of corruption and have a higher gross domestic product per capita, the report shows. The tiny country of Bhutan, a very happy country famous for measuring the \"Gross National Happiness\" of its people, gets the credit for focusing world attention on happiness: Its Prime Minister proposed the idea of a World Happiness Day to the United Nations in 2011. Recognizing \"happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world,\" the U.N. General Assembly declared March 20 as World Happiness Day in 2012. This officially designated happy date marked its fourth year last month. Through the happiness report, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network hopes to encourage governments at every level to measure and improve their people\\'s happiness. \"There is no single key to happiness,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, the network\\'s director and an economics professor at Columbia University. \"All of these countries do well in several ways. Being rich? That\\'s good, but it\\'s only a modest part of the story. Trusting society, having a government that ranks on low in corruption, a society where people are generous and volunteering -- all of these are important for happiness.\" Even if you don\\'t live in one of the 10 happiest countries in the world, a visit to these happy places will give you a taste of what the locals enjoy every day. Here are the top 10 happiest places on Earth, according to the World Happiness Report. 1. Switzerland . Switzerland took the top spot from Denmark in 2015, rising from third to first place in this year\\'s list of the world\\'s happiest countries. Bern, the capital city of Switzerland, has the cobblestone streets and medieval architecture that make it apparent why the old city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the city\\'s founding in the 12th century, it has expanded in an often neat and orderly fashion. And the lovely River Aare offers in-town swimming and boating. Looking to get out of the capital city? Book a trip to Lucerne, where you can take a boat trip on the lake, ride the panorama gondola, take in the views on the new Dragon Ride aerial cableway and ride on the world\\'s steepest cog railway. Book the Golden Round trip and get all four trips -- and stunning views of the Alps -- in one day. (The railway reopens in mid-May.) And no matter where you go, there will certainly be plenty of delicious chocolate to try. 2. Iceland . Nature and culture combine to make Iceland a truly happy place, so delightful that the tiny country jumped from ninth to second place this year. Explore South Iceland, where many of the ancient tales -- called sagas -- that document Iceland\\'s 10th- and 11th-century history are remembered.  A two-hour drive from the capital city of Reykjavik, south Iceland is home to Vatnajokull Glacier, the 60-meter (197-foot) Skogafoss Waterfall and amazing fresh seafood. (Though you could probably skip the fermented shark ...) No matter where you visit, there\\'s probably a geothermal swimming pool or hot spring spa to soak your weary bones after a long day of exploring. And when you get back to the capital, note that the renowned annual Reykjavik Art Festival will take place from May 17 through June 7. 3. Denmark . Never mind that Denmark lost the top spot this year and is now the third-happiest country in the world. Looking at all that Danes have to be happy about, you won\\'t notice the slight dip while you\\'re enjoying jazz at the Copenhagen Jazz Festival in July, hanging out with the hipsters at Queen Louise\\'s Bridge, taking a canal tour or playing beach volleyball in front of the Royal Danish Playhouse. Prefer your music in the woods? Head to Smuk Fest (\"The Beautiful Festival\"), a rock/pop festival in the woods of Skanderborg held in August. Wherever you go, enjoy that Danish tradition of \"hygge,\" sometimes translated too simply as the need for \"coziness.\" It\\'s really a complex sense of intimacy, community and contentment that generally happens with friends and family, and it makes for one happy country. Project Happy: 10 ways to get happy . 4. Norway . The sun never sets in some parts of Norway during the summer months, and the North Cape area is one of the best spots to play when the sun stays out for 24 hours. Visitors love to golf, hike and even run a marathon during the months ruled by the midnight sun. If your taste buds dictate your travels, head to the Norwegian capital city of Oslo, a gastronomic paradise where the Michelin food guide has awarded five stars among four restaurants: Ylajali, Statholdergaarden and Fauna (one star each) and Maeemo (two stars). 5. Canada . Canada combines European style, sensibility and history with the enormous natural wonder of North America. Within the French-speaking province of Quebec, a tour through the historic city of Old Quebec is a treat for any Francophile. Founded in the early 17th century, it\\'s the only North American city north of Mexico that still has its fortifications. The historic district is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Just a few minutes from downtown Quebec City, Ile d\\'Orleans is a small island where farming and agriculture are still a way of life. And if nature is what you crave, in less an hour from Québec City, you could be hiking through the Parc national de la Jacques-Cartier, home to the glacial Vallée de la Jacques-Cartier. 50 states, 50 spots to get happy around the U.S. 6. Finland . What a happy event to spot the rare Saimaa ringed seal, which adapted to freshwater living after the Ice Age cut off its lake home from the sea. There are only about 300 of them in the world, and they can be found at Lake Saimaa in eastern Finland. But you might have more luck spotting the white whooper swan, Finland\\'s national bird, whose arrival heralds the start of spring.

And you can still spot animals in the capital city: In mid-May, the cows will be herded into the fields in Viikki, a neighborhood in Helsinki, after the long winter. Locals always gather to celebrate this moo-ving event. 7. Netherlands (Holland) Though the Netherlands\\' tulips are without equal, and they are most stunning at Keukenhof (known as the Garden of Europe), there are so many beautiful spots across the country to walk and bike to welcome spring and its trademark flower. For a more regal celebration, note that the kingdom celebrates its 200th year this year with many festivities. 8. Sweden . In a country that\\'s very fond of celebration, Swedes love to celebrate midsummer, the longest day of the year, most of all. It\\'s a national holiday marked with traditional food and dances around a maypole. Can\\'t make the midsummer parties? There\\'s still plenty to do. Just 20 minutes from the capital city of Stockholm, the Stockholm Archipelago of about 30,000 islands offers endless opportunities for contentment. Swimming, hiking, cycling, fishing, horseback riding -- it\\'s all within your reach by booking a boat ride. (Some boat trips include meals and tours of many of the islands.) 9. New Zealand . New to the top 10 list of happiest countries, New Zealand has plenty of reasons to celebrate. Though it\\'s always been an attractive spot to explore, Peter Jackson choosing the country to host the filming of the \"Lord of the Rings\" movie trilogy has given New Zealand more attention than money could buy. The capital city of Wellington has benefited from the growth of the movie industry, developing a happening restaurant and design scene. And many of the country\\'s natural wonders have gained international attention, including the 2,291-meter (7,516-foot)-high Mount Ngauruhoe, which played the fictional Mount Doom. It\\'s part of Tongariro National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 10. Australia . The Great Barrier Reef, the world\\'s largest collection of coral reefs, is a natural phenomenon not to be missed. Australians are arguing fiercely over manmade threats to its existence  (and no one is happy about that). Once you\\'ve had a chance to explore that magical underwater realm, head to the Australian state of Tasmania, an island 240 kilometers (149 miles) off the mainland coast. The Tasmanian Wilderness, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, includes one of the last surviving temperate rainforests in the world. To see the wilderness up close, try hiking the stunning 65-kilometer (40-mile) Overland Track. It takes about six days for hikers (who must book the trip in advance), but day-trippers can take short hikes starting at Cradle Mountain Visitor Centre and Dove Lake.',\n",

The Virgin Mary Church was torched and looted by a mob, some of whom chanted against Coptic Christians and called for Egypt to become an \"Islamic state,\" one of at least 42 churches and many more businesses and homes targeted that August, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch reports. Others attacked included St. George Church in Sohag, a city south of Cairo on the Nile River, and Prince Tadros Church in Fayoum, which is southwest of Cairo, according to reports. In addition to those getting life sentences, two minors were sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds (about $1,300), Egypt\\'s official Egynews reported. Most of those sentenced -- 52 of the 73 defendants -- were tried in absentia, with 21 already in prison, according to Egynews. Some blamed the church and other attacks on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement that backed Mohamed Morsy. Morsy became Egypt\\'s first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsy was pushed out by Egypt\\'s military. Morsy was sentenced to 20 years in prison earlier this month after being convicted on charges related to violence outside the presidential palace in December 2012.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)More than 22 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste. The semipro football player for the Boston Bandits was 27. Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. Testimony in the case against Hernandez began in January. On Wednesday, a Fall River, Massachusetts, jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former New England patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life without parole,  as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. Hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He has pleaded not guilty. Just two years ago, he was one of the NFL\\'s most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots. Friends and fans alike wondered: How could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder? Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. \"I don\\'t think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol,\" Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN. The young Hernandez was the \"golden boy,\" playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community. Hernandez\\'s father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends. \"I saw a closeness with them that I\\'d never seen before,\" Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father. But his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery. Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and trouble seemed to follow. In just his first semester, a police report says, Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum. The following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports linked Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot. Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel. At the time, Hernandez\\'s mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, \"I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting.\" The case remains open, and no one has been charged. Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year. Trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots director of personnel. \"If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season. ... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test,\" he wrote, according to the Boston Globe. Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first- or second-round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him. By the end of his second season, he was a bona fide star, landing the $40 million contract extension. Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd\\'s murder. When Odin Lloyd pulled up in a black Chevrolet suburban, Boston Bandits coach Mike Branch thought something was out of place. Lloyd didn\\'t own a car. Aaron Hernandez case: Who\\'s who? Branch had his suspicions, but he couldn\\'t get answers. Lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night. \"He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money,\" Branch recalled. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night. Lloyd\\'s friends say he wasn\\'t a big partier. He was more passionate about football and family. Remembering Odin Lloyd . Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the all-American who made it. Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna, who\\'s engaged to Hernandez and is the mother of his little girl. On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez. Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he\\'d see him later. The next day, Lloyd\\'s body was found. Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez\\'s two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. At the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd\\'s phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with \"Nfl,\" adding, \"just so u know.\" Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez\\'s driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene. Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them. Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges. He pleaded not guilty. In April 2014, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged in Lloyd\\'s slaying. They, too, pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it\\'s not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in Lloyd\\'s murder. As the trial for the death of Lloyd neared, lawyers began arguing about evidence, including cell phones and text messages. Some rulings were victories for the defense. The jury wouldn\\'t see the text Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with \"Nfl.\" The judge ruled it hearsay and said the state hadn\\'t proven Lloyd believed his life was in danger. Jurors also didn\\'t hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been. The judge agreed with defense lawyers that it\\'s far too prejudicial and irrelevant to Lloyd\\'s murder. Investigators allege Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink. District Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts courtroom in May, saying Hernandez became \"angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. Abreu smiled and did not apologize.\" Prosecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide . Hernandez\\'s friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would go on to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later. After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said. Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said. He then pulled up to the victims\\' car at a red light and leaned out the driver\\'s side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court. Hernandez allegedly said, \"Yo, what\\'s up now,\" followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a .38-caliber revolver, Haggan said. Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. Furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Haggan said. Hernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty. Investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of Lloyd.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)A large storm system dubbed Typhoon Maysak is churning over the Pacific Ocean, days away from a possible direct hit on the Philippines. Maysak is moving west-northwest after skirting the Federated States of Micronesia, according to the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Its eye is projected to make landfall in the central or northern part of the Philippine island of Luzon on Sunday, though the country\\'s residents could start feeling its effects days before. That could interrupt the Easter celebration for many in the predominantly Catholic nation, which may be socked by heavy rains and potent winds. The International Red Cross noted that \"many people are expected to throng coastal areas at this time.\" Images of the typhoon as seen from the International Space Station were posted to Twitter, including a Vine video showing the swirling eye of the storm. The storm has weakened and is expected to lose more strength before it reaches the Philippines. Its maximum sustained winds on Wednesday were 150 mph, making it a super typhoon in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\\'s definition. But by Thursday, the winds\\' strength had declined to around 132 mph -- no longer a super typhoon but still the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera told CNN that Maysak could weaken further to become a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Philippine coast. \"This will not be a catastrophic storm,\" Cabrera said. That said, it could still cause flooding and bring strong winds, he cautioned. The Philippines is frequently hit by typhoons. In December, for instance, Hagupit killed at least 18 people in the East Asian nation and injured hundreds more. But that devastation paled in comparison to the havoc wrought by Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, which killed more than 6,000 people and injured more than 27,000 others. That typhoon, considered to be among the strongest storms ever to make landfall, hit the eastern city of Tacloban especially hard. The irony of the upcoming storm is its timing: in April, just after the Philippines Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration officially declared the onset of the nation\\'s dry, or summer, season. PAGASA meteorologist Shelley Ignacio predicts Maysak -- which is called Chedeng in the Philippines -- will bring heavy rains to Luzon starting on Friday, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. The country\\'s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council went on red alert on Wednesday because of the storm, the news agency reports. That alert means all relevant personnel are on standby and the public should be on guard for possible effects of the storm. CNN\\'s Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Late one night on Facebook, a girl with cystic fibrosis messaged a boy with cystic fibrosis, and both their lives were changed forever. The girl, Katie Donovan, read that the boy, Dalton Prager, was very sick.  \"If you ever need a friend to talk to, you can reach out to me,\" she wrote. \"Sorry, but do I know you?\" he responded. No, you don\\'t, Katie wrote back, and told Dalton a bit about herself. Like him, she was 18, and \"my breathing is pretty crappy and I see you are in the hospital. I\\'m sorry. I know it sucks!...But you just gotta stay strong.\" Messages between the two flew back and forth. They realized they were falling in love. For most other couples, the next step would be to meet in person. But for Katie and Dalton, that was complicated -- and dangerous. Cystic fibrosis patients shouldn\\'t be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs. Dr. Michael Anstead at the University of Kentucky, Katie\\'s pulmonologist since she was a little girl, had lectured her many times that face-to-face meetings with other CF patients were a bad idea. In their online conversations, one of the first things Dalton told Katie about himself was that he had Burkholderia cepacia, a horribly dangerous infection for people with CF. \"I was like, \\'Hi, I\\'m Dalton from Missouri and I have Burkholderia cepacia,\\' because it\\'s such a big deal in the CF community,\" he remembers. \"I left the decision about whether we should meet up completely up to her.\" Katie listened to her heart, even if it might hurt her lungs. She asked Dalton to come visit her in Flemingsburg, Kentucky. \"I told Dalton I\\'d rather be happy -- like really, really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years,\" Katie says. \"That was definitely something I had to think about, but when you have those feelings, you just know.\" So on August 28, 2009, Dalton drove more than six hours from St. Charles, Missouri, to Katie\\'s hometown in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, where they\\'d arranged to meet at the Dairy Queen. At 7:10 pm -- they remember the time precisely -- Katie got out of her car and saw Dalton leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses. \"My heart was racing, but I just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello,\" she remembers. \"I\\'m usually not that kind of girl, but it just felt so right.\" Katie took Dalton and his mother, Renee, who\\'d made the trip with him, to have dinner with her and her parents, Debbie and John Donovan. Later the young couple drove around Flemingsburg, and Dalton gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday, which was two days before. Their health quickly deteriorated, and within months, the new husband and wife went on oxygen full time. Too ill to work, Dalton quit his job at his family\\'s auto repair shop, and Katie quit hers as a store clerk. In August, 2014, the couple entered the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center together to wait for new lungs. Dalton\\'s came first, and on November 17, he had his transplant. Despite his Burkholderia cepacia, which makes transplants more complicated, it was a success. \"I was so thrilled. I was so happy for him,\" Katie says. The month after Dalton\\'s surgery, UPMC discharged Katie -- she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while. When she had serious trouble breathing three days later she tried to get back into the hospital, but  UPMC informed her she\\'d used up her supply of Medicare days and wouldn\\'t accept her. Medicare -- the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities -- wouldn\\'t pay for another hospitalization until Katie had been out of the hospital for sixty days. But Katie was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days, much less sixty. So Katie relied on Medicaid, public insurance that was supplied by her home state of Kentucky. She was admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital, where she was cared for by Anstead, her beloved pulmonologist. But then, another hurdle. Anstead explained that most lung transplant centers, including the two in Kentucky, don\\'t do transplants on patients with Burkholderia cepacia, referring them to larger centers like UPMC that have more experience with such complicated cases. Katie and Dalton, now 24 and 23, were desperate. Her doctors predicted she wouldn\\'t live a year without new lungs. Going on her husband\\'s private insurance wasn\\'t an option, since Dalton is on his father\\'s policy. In February, Anstead wrote a letter to Medicaid, pleading with them to make an exception and pay for Katie\\'s care at UPMC, even though it was out of state. Kentucky Medicaid denied his plea, and that\\'s when the squabbling began. In a statement to CNN, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services pointed the finger at UPMC, saying the medical center had declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. \"Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,\" wrote the spokeswoman, Gwenda Bond. \"Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.\" UPMC counters that Kentucky Medicaid told them that if they want to care for Katie, they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients. While UPMC spokeswoman Wendy Zellner didn\\'t elaborate, a hospital might be loathe to sign up for large-scale coverage of out-of-state Medicaid patients as payments under such programs are typically very low. Asking for hundreds of doctors to sign up to take Kentucky Medicaid is \"an unusually restrictive approach and contrary to single-case agreements that we have signed with other state Medicaid programs,\" Zellner wrote. \"UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation.\" Today, Katie waits in limbo in her hospital bed, hoping that the three parties -- Medicare, Medicaid, and UPMC -- will work things out so she can get her new lungs. \"I feel like they\\'re putting a dollar sign on my life,\" she says. \"I don\\'t want to die because of money. That\\'s stupid. Nobody should have to do that.\" If Katie doesn\\'t get her transplant, not only will she die, but she\\'ll never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection, which could be deadly for him as he\\'s on drugs to suppress his immune system. As a result of inquiries from CNN, on Wednesday Aaron Albright, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services arranged for a caseworker to call Katie at the hospital. But it didn\\'t go very well. Katie says the caller, who identified herself as Pat Pierorazio, was \"rude, mean, and angry.\" \"She said someone had told her to call me, and she acted like it was just a pain to have to be talking to me,\" she says. Katie says the Medicare representative told her she would look into her situation. In a statement, Albright with CMS wrote to CNN: \"We are working quickly to fully understand this difficult and complex situation so that this patient can get the care she needs. CMS is reaching out to the state agency to find a solution as soon as  possible.\" Caught in the middle between the hospital and insurance, Katie tries to stay strong, just as she advised her husband to do nearly six years ago in their first Facebook conversation. Skyping with Dalton helps, and raising money on their Facebook page keeps her mind busy. And she\\'s always thinking about their \"after transplant bucket list,\" which they keep in a safe in their house so it won\\'t be destroyed by fire or flood. On the list: Drive through every state. Learn another language and visit a country where they speak it. Write a book together about their love story. They have simpler dreams as well. Like going grocery shopping together, or sitting side by side on the couch to watch television. And this is their biggest goal: . \"I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug. That\\'s all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary,\" she says. Wednesday afternoon, there were signs of hope. Zeller, the UPMC spokeswoman, sent an email to CNN. \"Ky Medicaid has reached out to us to talk. So stay tuned,\" she wrote. Katie and Dalton were glad to hear it. \"I don\\'t care what I have to do to get her lungs,\" Dalton said. \"I will just keep trying until there\\'s nothing left to try.\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Garissa, Kenya (CNN)The sign painted onto the school entrance wall reads: \"Youth is a mistake, adulthood is a struggle, old age is a regret.\" The black humor of the message provides some light relief for a school that lives in constant fear of a terrorist attack because of what is taught inside its walls. The students (aged 8 to 14) at the Ibnu-Siina school in northern Kenya are getting a so-called \"Western\" education, taking lessons in subjects like mathematics, science and English. But it\\'s an education that Al-Shabaab -- the Somali-based terror group -- is trying to prevent the children from obtaining, according to the head of the school. \"These men, Al-Shabaab, want to make sure everything goes negative,\" headmaster James Ndonye told CNN. \"They want to make sure they terrify the teachers so they go to their homes -- so the kids in this area don\\'t get what they deserve.\" Al-Shabaab militants have launched a series of deadly attacks over the last few years in the region mostly targeting Christians. Many of the math and science teachers in this area are Christian. In early April, Al-Shabaab brutally massacred 147 people at Garissa University in northern Kenya. It was the group\\'s deadliest attack to date. The gunmen would have driven down the road past the Ibnu-Siina school -- and its single unarmed guard -- to get to the university, only a few hundred meters away. Kenyan teachers and students alike are terrified. \"The University College of Garissa was the only and first university college in northern Kenya. We were happy when we got it a few years ago,\" explained Garissa Regional Governor Nadif Jama. \"Today it has been closed. That is Al-Shabaab\\'s mission,\" Jama said. \"That is what they want. And that is nothing but destroying the fabric of our being a civilized society.\" And it\\'s not just in Kenya. Terrorist groups across the Sahel region are waging war on schools, teachers and students. In northeast Nigeria, the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has been waging war against the government -- and the civilian population -- for several years. Most notoriously, perhaps, was Boko Haram\\'s kidnapping of around 270 girls from a boarding school in Chibok, Borno state, last April. But the group has also carried out numerous other attacks on schools, slaughtering young boys and girls as they sleep in their dormitories. Last year in Garissa, James Ndonye lost five of his 11 teachers amid rising fears of an Al-Shabaab attack on the school. He replaced them, but it wasn\\'t easy. Yet despite the ever-present threat of terror, Ndonye has stayed to help the children. \"I risk my life because -- for this class, there\\'s a target we have for last year ... and I love that class very much,\" Ndonye said.

On the wall in another hangs a poster on proper preparation for Muslim prayer. These small reminders of college life at this Kenyan school belie the horror of what happened here: the slaughter of at least 147 people, many of them students who lived in this building. On Friday afternoon, more than 36 hours after the attack, investigators and Kenya Red Cross crews were finishing up the task of removing the bodies of dead students. The corpses of four Al-Shabaab attackers -- dressed head to toe in black and still clutching their AK-47s -- remained where they fell, their bodies shattered in a torrent of bullets. Kenya terrorist attack: 6 things you need to know . Investigators marked the locations of students\\' bodies with numbered tags before Red Cross workers came in to send them off to morgues. They would call out to each other with the locations of the dead, reducing once promising lives, for the time being at least, to numbers. 221. 214. 216. 217. Sometimes, the cell phones of the dead would ring, taking the workers aback. Beyond the bodies, evidence of what had happened at the dormitory was everywhere. Shattered glass and shell casings littered the floor. Walls and ceilings were marred by bullet holes. In some places, the blood was as thick as mud. The problems plaguing Kenya\\'s security efforts . According to students and authorities, militants burst onto the campus around 5 a.m. Thursday. The gunmen, from the Al-Shabaab terror group, first stormed a Christian prayer service, killing some students, taking others hostage. They rampaged across the campus, shooting non-Muslims, sparing Muslims, a witness said. One student, Hellen Titus, told CNN she hid inside a wardrobe for nearly an hour before the gunmen came for her. Come out, they told her, you won\\'t be shot. \"They were lying,\" she said. The gunmen herded her and maybe three dozen other students into a community room where they\\'d usually hang out and watch television. They were told to lie down, lectured about how the Quran forbids killing women. And then the men, Titus said, were shot in the head. One of the gunmen egged on the others. \"Shoot them! Shoot them!\" he would say, according to Titus. More lecturing: the land, the gunmen said, didn\\'t belong to nonbelievers. We, the gunmen said, have just two missions: to kill, and be killed. And then they started shooting the women. \"Anyone who is breathing, shoot them,\" Titus said the gunman in charge said. \"We just lay there hopelessly, because we know automatically we\\'re going to be killed,\" Titus said. It was then she saw the blood of a fellow student coursing toward her on the floor. She smeared it onto her face and body to make it appear she, too, was dead. \"In the time of shooting, they skipped me,\" she said. She survived with only a hand wound. Many of the other students were shot in the back of the head, a medic told CNN. Others had been beheaded, according to people who had viewed bodies at the morgue in Chiromo. Even longtime relief workers such as Reuben Nyaora with the International Rescue Committee said they were shocked at what they saw. \"I have seen many things,\" Nyaora told Agence France-Presse, \"but nothing like that.\" Opinion: A weakened Al-Shabaab lashes out .

Petrobras was long considered the corporate jewel in Brazil's crown, one of the biggest companies in the world by market capitalization. But last year, investigators launched a sweeping investigation. According to suspects-turned-witnesses, construction companies paid bribes to executives at Petrobras as well as politicians to secure lucrative contracts. Most of the politicians accused in the investigation belong to the President's Workers Party and its allies. During many of the years that the alleged corruption took place, Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras. There hasn't been any evidence she was involved with the scheme, and her supporters say the position is merely a figurehead. Rousseff has defended Brazilians' right to protest and acknowledged the need to clean up corruption at Petrobras -- but denied any prior knowledge of it. But Brazilians are still outraged. Rousseff won re-election with just over 50% of valid votes in October, but her approval rating plummeted to 13% after the protests last month. Compounding the frustration is the economy, which is expected to contract this year. Inflation is stubbornly high, and the currency has lost more than 20% of its value against the dollar this year alone. Both sides are. The country was already sharply divided during presidential elections in October. Roughly half of the voting population didn't vote for Rousseff, and many of those same people joined protests immediately after elections. Rousseff's supporters like to characterize the protesters as Brazilian elite and right-wingers, and some small groups do carry signs calling for a military intervention to oust the President. But with the Petrobras scandal growing and the economy sinking, the protests have gotten bigger and broader, with many demonstrators saying they initially voted for Rousseff. Protesters say Rousseff should be impeached for failing to halt the corruption at Petrobras. On the other hand, labor unions, social activists and groups such as the Landless Workers Movement who support the government have organized their own marches. The demonstrations are meant as a show of force for democracy, with participants saying the President was democratically elected and cannot be impeached. But participation has not been consistently strong. The President has said Petrobras should be cleaned up. Has she done anything about it? She says she's given prosecutors and the Federal Police free rein to investigate the Petrobas scandal. Some of her allies who have been implicated in the investigation think Rousseff should do more to protect them. This scandal has been known publicly for at least a year, and during Rousseff's election campaign, she said she would root out corruption. The Brazilian economy was booming for the good part of a decade, bolstered by voracious demand for its commodities from China. But with China's economy cooling, Brazil has failed to find a successful alternative to promote growth and shore up investor confidence. Now, with the President's approval rating abysmally low, it will be difficult to implement the savings needed to get the economy back on track. Rousseff has appointed a market-friendly economy minister, Joaquim Levy, to try and fix the country's fiscal problems. But in the current political crisis, he hasn't been able to make much progress.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Every week in the heart of Nima, a slum in the Ghanaian capital of Accra, families congregate at a local mosque. When the time comes, young girls say goodbye to their loved ones and part ways, filing up concrete steps leading up to the floor above. There, inside a large room dotted with brown tables, rows of flashing computer screens await for them. \"When the parents are praying [downstairs], we are teaching the girls upstairs,\" explains tech entrepreneur Regina Agyare, who comes here every week to teach local teens how to code. Agyare\\'s first visit to see the girls -- students at education project Achievers Ghana -- was in January 2014. This was supposed to be a one-off seminar as part of her mentorship initiative \"Tech Needs Girls\" -- however, the students proved quite a draw. \"I fell in love with them, so I decided to set up a coding club and started having regular sessions,\" says Agyare, founder of software development company Soronko Solutions. More importantly, continues Agyare, it offered the opportunity to show \"the community the value of educating girls.\" A predominantly Muslim area in a largely Christian nation, Nima has one of the densest populations in Accra. Agyare says life is often challenging for many  local girls, with some growing up without ever leaving the community. \"Girls were being forced to marry early; [denied] their right to go to school. Most of their dreams and aspirations were limited to just what was around them. \"I was shocked... I thought we had progressed as a nation. I thought we had gone past that.\" This, in part, was why Agyare lent her support to Achievers Ghana. Set up by local Amadu Mohammad, the non-profit organization supports 250 girls between the age of six and 18, priming them for formal education through extracurricular classes in reading, math, poetry and information technology. Its goal is to break through social barriers and provide Nima with a generation of female role models, and so the group provides school funding to help the girls shape their own future. The project was bequeathed its classroom above the mosque it shares a building with, and Agyare says the two work closely together. Achievers Ghana met initial resistance from local conservatives, but when the mosque\\'s chief imam Sheik Hussein Abdul Rahman championed Mohammad\\'s vision, few maintained their reservations. Now, with parents paying a nominal fee towards the running of the organization, it is in everyone\\'s interest that the girls succeed. Fourteen months after her first visit, Agyare\\'s coding class is well established. She has set up a mentor scheme as part of \"Tech Needs Girls,\" recruiting and training women at university to act as role models for her younger students in Nima. In each class, around 50 girls are taught HTML and run a blog called \"Slum Voices\". \"I definitely feel [technology] has given them more of a voice,\" Agyare says. \"I feel like it\\'s allowed them to express themselves and interact with others... for them, it\\'s important to be heard.\" Some girls had never used a computer before the classes began, but Agyare\\'s even-handed approach has brought all her students up to the same standard. Agyare insists that \"we don\\'t leave anyone behind.\" To that end, a few young male faces have found their way into her classroom. This was an accidental revelation, according to Agyare. She details the story of one affronted boy. \"He wrote that he didn\\'t like it when he saw girls learning about computers... it was difficult [for him] to see girls being empowered; he wasn\\'t used to that.\" Agyare realized that by integrating genders in her classroom she could begin to confront gender expectations. For many boys the role of a girl is \"to be their wife,\" Agyare explains, \"and she needs to be taken care of.\" However, by running mixed classes boys from an early age \"can learn to see a woman as a contributing person [within society].\" Now the hope is that many of the young students will be able to go to university -- and Achievers Ghana is working on a scholarship program to make the prospect attainable. Agyare says the goal is not to turn every girl into software developers but to enable them to \"use technology in whatever field they find themselves.\" She adds: \"It would be great if we had some girls that decided to go on and study computer science, but really it\\'s about helping them reach their full potential ... and bring change to the community.\" Read this: 5 reasons why tech needs geek girls .

              " {'sequence': 'London (CNN)Time\\'s running out for Britons to decide who they\\'ll back, as polling booths prepare to open across the country in an election that could change the political landscape. It\\'s been a blink-and-you-miss-it campaign, especially by U.S. standards, where candidates can take years to finesse their messages. The election could result in the handing of power from David Cameron\\'s Conservative government to the Labour Party, led by Ed Miliband -- or a frenzy of wrangling from leaders as they attempt to forge alliances with smaller parties. But that\\'s all to come when polls close late Thursday evening, local time. Very strict rules govern the reporting of UK elections, but until they kick in, here are some things you should know -- who are the candidates, what are the issues, who\\'s likely to win, why bacon sandwiches matter, what is \"UKIP\" and, if the Queen isn\\'t in charge, what does she do? The Queen doesn\\'t run Britain . Before we get on to the candidates, let\\'s dispel one common misconception. Queen Elizabeth II is officially Britain\\'s head of state, but she\\'s only nominally in charge. She signs off on legislation and appoints new prime ministers but has no real power, so no beheadings but maybe a few disapproving stares. Officially, she\\'s politically neutral. The closest she apparently comes to expressing opinion is -- savor this image -- \"purring\" like a cat. Visit: Windsor Castle, the Queen\\'s country residence (Windsor and Maidenhead; +44 20 7766 7304), royalcollection.org.uk/visit/windsorcastle . So who are they voting for? Duh, they\\'re voting for a new prime minister. Well, actually no. In presidential elections Americans vote in each state for \"electors,\" who support the candidate they want to lead the country. But in a UK parliamentary the vote is more indirectly aimed at appointing a new government. Voters put their \"X\" next to the local stooge/aspiring public servant from whichever political party they support. Votes are tallied by constituencies -- political fiefdoms, really -- some of which date back centuries to when Britain was run by barons, or maybe even elves -- each with a seat in parliament. The party that wins most seats then gets to say who becomes prime minister, pending the final thumbs up from Her Majesty. Of course, in reality, people may be swayed by party figureheads and see voting as a direct endorsement of their leadership, personality or -- true things -- their ability to eat bacon sandwiches and point at fish. Visit: Hampstead Heath -- a beautiful north London green space that lies partly within the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency, likely to be one of the most hotly contested of the election. (South Hill Park Gardens, London; +44 20 7332 3322). Is that a fair system? Kinda. But also kinda not, since it means a party can easily win power without winning the most votes. That\\'s because Britain\\'s elections are run on a \"first-past-the-post\" basis. It\\'s an analogy that highlights how similar British politics is to horse racing, just with fewer doping scandals. Here\\'s how it works: . The elected parliament consists of 650 seats, each representing a different number of constituents -- anywhere between 21,000 and 110,000. Only the candidate who wins most votes in each constituency gets a seat. No prizes for second place. Of course there have been reform demands from smaller parties stiffed by the system, but since they never win against the two main parties, they\\'re powerless to change anything. The centrist Liberal Democrats, for instance, had 6.8 million votes (23% of the total) at the last election, but won just 57 seats. The Conservatives claimed 307 with just 10.7 million votes. Visit: Luskentyre beach, Isle of Harris. The stunning islands of the Outer Hebrides, off the western coast of mainland Scotland, are part of the UK\\'s smallest constituency by voter numbers. visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/luskentyre-sands . So who\\'s going to win? British elections are typically viewed as a two-horse race -- an analogy that highlights how similar they are to races involving two horses, only with fewer horses. The prime candidates are incumbent David Cameron, head of the center-right Conservatives, and Ed Miliband, leader of the center-left Labour Party. Opinion polls say there\\'s no clear favorite. That\\'ll mean -- as it did in 2010 -- that the spoils of victory could be claimed by whoever can successfully horse (yes, horse) trade to build a majority coalition alongside smaller parties. If that happens, eyes will be on the smaller parties including the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and the upstart UK Independence Party. UKIP\\'s leader Nigel Farage is a political outsider who\\'s won support for being anti-immigration, anti-Europe and pro-beer. His party isn\\'t expected to win many seats, but it could result in some unlikely romancing -- as the last vote did when the LibDems hopped into bed with the Conservatives, much to the anger of some supporters. Visit: Ascot Racecourse. Enough with the horse analogies already. Check out the real thing at the Queen\\'s favorite track. High Street, Ascot, West Berkshire, ascot.co.uk . What are the issues? There\\'s the future of Britain\\'s cherished yet financially challenged National Health Service -- the free medicare system that\\'s undergone so many botched political procedures in recent years, it can barely bring itself to take off the bandages. UKIP\\'s rise has spurred uncomfortable cross-party pledges to beef up controls to end decades of population-swelling immigration, a concern, apparently, among Britain\\'s descendants of Viking, Norman, Roman and Anglo-Saxon invaders. There\\'s the economy -- how to tackle Britain\\'s budget deficit and foster financial recovery (without relying on the cheap immigrant labor that the politicians want to stop entering.) And there\\'s Europe -- another UKIP-generated issue that has forced the main parties into posturing against the European Union, even though many supporters suspect withdrawing would be disastrous, not just for the economy, but for future fish-pointing opportunities.

Think this all sounds too boring for words? You\\'re not the only one, which is a major problem for the politicians seeking election. Political apathy is on the rise in the UK, with many younger voters expressing disillusionment with party leaders they say are out of touch and barely distinguishable from one another, even if one \"looks like a panda\" and the other a \"pink condom.\" It doesn\\'t help the politicians\\' cause when popular comedians such as Russell Brand denounce voting in favor of an as-yet unspecified \"revolution.\" However, he later changed his mind after meeting Miliband, and urged people to vote Labour. Still, UK elections aren\\'t without their entertainment -- most notably provided by fringe candidates. From 1963 until 1995, a feature of every vote count was Screaming Lord Sutch, an odd-looking pop star whose Official Monster Raving Loony Party campaigned for many lost causes that later became reality, such as commercial radio and the scrapping of dog licenses. In the 2010 election other eccentric candidates included Lord Biro, who campaigned on policies that included the appointment of Bono as Pope. Mad Cap\\'n Tom also pledged to train schoolchildren in \"swordsmanship and gunnery\" by imposing a 50% tax on downloads of Cheryl Cole songs \"because I hate Cheryl Cole.\" Whatever their motivation, come election night when they get their moment on stage with serious political rivals, they often get better laughs than Brand.

The Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab is responsible for the attack in the center of Mogadishu, group spokesman Abu Musab said. The attack began when two suicide bombers detonated their car at the entrance of the two-story building housing the Ministry of Education, Culture & Higher Education, Somali National Security Ministry spokesman Mohamed Yusuf said. Five gunmen then entered the building, shooting people inside, Yusuf said. Security guards at the building, and, later, Somali special forces battled the gunmen inside, witnesses said. Soldiers from the African Union, who are in Somalia in part to support the government's fight against Al-Shabaab, teamed up with Somali security forces to shoot and kill the five attackers, Yusuf said. The attack killed four Somali soldiers and eight civilians, according to Yusuf. The special forces helped people out of the building while the attack was underway, city police Capt. Mohamud Abdi said. Ali Hassan, a man who was helped from the building, confirmed that a rescue operation was happening inside. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has battled the country's government for years, aiming to overthrow it and turn the nation into a fundamentalist Islamic state. In recent years, the group also launched terror attacks beyond Somalia's borders, sometimes targeting non-Muslims. What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want? Earlier this month, Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in neighboring Kenya, killing 147 people, mostly students. The terrorists separated Christians from Muslims and shot those who couldn't recite verses from the Quran, witnesses said. In Somalia, Al-Shabaab has been blamed for attacks that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. Late last month, Al-Shabaab militants detonated a bomb and sprayed bullets at a Mogadishu hotel, leaving at least 20 people dead in an attack that lasted a number of hours.

Ellanora Arthur Baidoo has been trying to divorce her husband for several years, according to her attorney, Andrew Spinnell. But, Spinnell said, he and his client haven\\'t been able to find Victor Sena Blood-Dzraku to serve him the papers.  Baidoo has been able to reach her husband by phone and \"he has told her that he has no fixed address and no place of employment,\" according to court documents. \"He has also refused to make himself available to be served,\" the document said. After exhausting other ways of serving him the papers, Spinnell filed an application asking for \"service by alternate means,\" in this case, via social media. In his decision, Justice Matthew Cooper said the \"advent and ascendency of social media,\" means sites like Facebook and Twitter are the \"next frontier\" as \"forums through which a summons can be delivered.\" Before Cooper agreed to her using Facebook, Baidoo had to prove the Facebook account belongs to her husband, and that he consistently logs on to the account and would therefore see the summons. Spinnell said Baidoo\\'s marriage to Blood-Dzraku began to unravel shortly after they married in 2009 because her husband refused to participate in a Ghanian wedding ceremony that would include both their families . The couple never lived together, according to court documents. \"She\\'s not asking for any money,\" Spinnell said, \"She just wants to move on with her life and get a divorce.\" Spinnell said he has contacted Blood-Dzraku twice on Facebook, but has yet to hear back.

The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari, the deputy governor of Iran\\'s Sistan-Baluchestan province, who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan. Iranian officials have reportedly asked Pakistani authorities to catch the surviving assailants. A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization. According to Pakistani media, Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan, the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran. The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory. One of the deadliest was in October 2013, when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan. Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks, the militants have fled back into Balochistan. \"Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists,\" IRNA said, referring to Pakistan.

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)They took Yarmouk by storm, a sea of masked men flooding into the streets of one the world\\'s most beleaguered places. Besieged and bombed by Syrian forces for more than two years, the desperate residents of this Palestinian refugee camp near Damascus awoke in early April to a new, even more terrifying reality -- ISIS militants seizing Yarmouk after defeating several militia groups operating in the area. \"They slaughtered them in the streets,\" one Yarmouk resident, who asked not to be named, told CNN. \"They (caught) three people and killed them in the street, in front of people. The Islamic State is now in control of almost all the camp.\" An estimated 18,000 refugees are now trapped inside Yarmouk, stuck between ISIS and Syrian regime forces in \"the deepest circle of hell,\" in the words of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Yarmouk, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, was formed in 1957 to accommodate people fleeing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp. The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp in an effort to drive out armed groups. Activists and residents in Yarmouk tell CNN that as many as 5,000 people have tried to flee their homes since ISIS stormed the camp, but have no place to go. Hundreds have been injured, but the camp\\'s only functioning hospital was first occupied by ISIS, then targeted last week by regime shelling. As the fighting raged in Yarmouk, the director of the Jafra Foundation -- the only aid group that has been able to get into the camp -- painted a grim portrait of the conditions on the ground since ISIS arrived. \"We need medicine and access to treatment and medical facilities,\" Wesam Sabaneh told CNN. \"The last hospital in Yarmouk camp was bombed yesterday, so there\\'s really nothing functioning.\" Opinion: Save the \\'miracle babies\\' Even delivering clean water in Yarmouk can be a deadly task. Majed Alomari, the Jafra Foundation\\'s water coordinator, was killed a few days ago -- gunned down in an ISIS firefight with rival rebel groups. The head of the Palestinian League for Human Rights in Syria (PLHR), who fled the camp and Syria in October 2012, said the people of Yarmouk were in dire need of help. \"According to my contacts inside, people are back to consuming water with spices -- a common meal used in 2014\" during the Syrian regime\\'s siege of the camp, the PLHR\\'s Salim Salamah told CNN. Aid agencies briefly managed to break the government\\'s stranglehold on the camp last year, and delivered aid to tens of thousands. But now, as terror closes in on Yarmouk from all sides, residents have two choices -- to attempt to flee what was their place of refuge, or to stay inside what the U.N. says now resembles a camp of death. \"Now I am scared of two things -- I am scared of (ISIS) and the regime,\" the Yarmouk resident told CNN. \"The regime now is about to destroy the Yarmouk camp,\" he said. \"And ISIS, I don\\'t know ... they didn\\'t do anything except [rename] Yarmouk Camp as \\'Yarmouk Islamic State.\\'\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': '(CNN)Silent, almost shy as she headed into Manhattan Criminal Court, Ailina Tsarnaeva was anything but timid when it came to a perceived rival, prosecutors say. According to a criminal complaint, Tsarnaeva threatened a woman in a phone call this summer, saying \"Leave my man alone.\" \"Stop looking for him. ... I know people that can put a bomb where you live,\" she said, according to the complaint. Considering who was making the threats, prosecutors didn\\'t consider it a joke and charged Tsarnaeva with aggravated harassment, which she denies. Leaving court last December, she and her lawyer refused to discuss the case. Tsarnaeva is the sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Authorities allege the brothers are responsible for the 2013 Boston marathon bombing, which left three people dead and more than 260 others injured. Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, during the manhunt and later captured Dzhokhar, who is now on trial. Tsarnaev\\'s lawyers don\\'t dispute that he did it. The defense argues that he was influenced and enlisted by his older, self-radicalized brother to commit acts of terror. Defense rests in Boston Marathon bombing trial . The Tsarnaev family first immigrated to the Boston area back in 2002. The parents, fleeing a troubled region of Russia, were treated as legal residents and granted asylum -- a status that opened the door for taxpayer-funded welfare. The state of Massachusetts has confirmed the Tsarnaevs received food stamps, public housing and other aid, on and off, between 2002 and 2012. During this time, Tamerlan Tsarnaev began his conversion to radical Islam. Then, according to investigators, he began filling his younger brother\\'s head with a hatred toward the West. Not much is known about the two Tsarnaeva daughters, Ailina, 24, and Bella, 26, though their last known address was in North Bergen, New Jersey. Along with charges of making bomb threats, Ailina Tsarnaeva has a past record that includes misleading police in a counterfeiting case. She pleaded guilty but got no jail time. She was also charged with leaving the scene of an accident, but that charge was dismissed. Her older sister, Bella, was charged with marijuana possession and intent to distribute after a 2012 arrest, and she entered a pretrial intervention program. Even their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, has had issues with the law. She fled back to Russia in 2012, where she remains a fugitive. Records show that she was arrested in June 2012 for allegedly shoplifting $1,600 worth of women\\'s clothing from a Boston-area Lord & Taylor department store. She is wanted on felony charges of shoplifting and destruction of property. Russia raised concerns to U.S. authorities about her in 2011 at the same time they asked the United States about her son Tamerlan, several sources told CNN shortly after the 2013 attack. U.S. authorities added the mother and son to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database -- a collection of more than a half-million names maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, an intelligence official said. FBI agents interviewed Zubeidat Tsarnaev as part of the investigation into her son, whose case was closed after several months. The radicalization of Tsarnaev . In Russia, she has maintained her innocence in the shoplifting case while also calling the charges against her sons \"made up.\" Though not elaborating on her beliefs, Ailina Tsarnaeva has said she believes, as her mother does, that her surviving brother Dzhokhar and her dead brother Tamerlan are innocent. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 21, faces 30 criminal counts, including using a weapon of mass destruction causing death. On Tuesday, one day after federal prosecutors rested after calling more than 90 witnesses, defense lawyers rested their case without calling Tsarnaev to the stand. Closing arguments are expected Monday. Tsarnaev attorney: \\'It was him\\' Watch Erin Burnett weekdays 7pm ET. For the latest from Erin Burnett click here.',\n",

In scenes resembling a disaster movie, the inferno laid waste to a picturesque area the size of 100 football pitches. It came after days of storms lashed Britain, with trees felled and roads shut. But the 70 hectare area of Dorset was tinderbox dry as much of it is on a hillside and water had run off down the slope. Fire investigators have confirmed the fire was started deliberately and three separate areas of heath - measuring half a hectare, one hectare and 70 hectares - were destroyed . More than 80 firefighters spent six hours tackling flames up to 35ft high at the St Catherine's Hill nature reserve in Dorset yesterday . Thousands of animals are feared to have been wiped out by the blaze after yesterday's strong winds of up to 45mph, coupled with bone dry ground thanks to a lack of rain, whipped the flamed across across 70 hectres of heathland . The fire was sparked by suspected arsonists in three locations. Fanned by 40mph winds, flames up to 35ft high spread rapidly through the nature reserve near Christchurch. Eighty firefighters spent hours tackling the blaze. Crews had to contend with a 400 yard wide wall of flames that moved at dangerous speeds. The billowing smoke could be seen from around ten miles away in Wimborne and Swanage. A member of the public raised the alarm at midday on Tuesday. Firefighters remained at the scene in St Catherine’s Hill nature reserve until 1.15am yesterday, after the blaze was finally brought under control. Police are treating the fire as suspicious and have appealed for witnesses as they investigate what was used to start it. Two schoolboys have today been arrested for the arson attack that devastated the sensitive heathland. The youths, aged 14 and 15, are being held by police on suspicion of deliberately starting three fires. Firefighters said that while it has rained in the area, the hilly landscape meant little moisture remained near the top of the soil. There was also a lot of dead, dry growth left over from winter, which had been the sunniest since records began in 1929. Commander Craig Baker of Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘It is probably one of the largest heath fires we’ve had for a couple of years. The main problem yesterday was the strength of the wind.’ The area, a site of special scientific interest, is home to all six species of reptile native to the UK, including sand lizards, adders and grass snakes. Experts said thousands of creatures would have been killed by the blaze. Around 50 wildlife volunteers were yesterday rescuing reptiles that survived. Nicky Hoar from Dorset Wildlife Trust said it would take 20 to 30 years for the heathland ecosystem to fully recover. Dorset Police have confirmed they are treating the fire as suspicious and investigations are ongoing but no arrests have been made yet . Billowing black smoke could be seen from 10 miles away in Wimborne and Swanage as crews battled to get the 400 metre wide fire under control . The heathland is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and home to all six species of reptile native to the UK; the sand lizard, smooth snake, adders, slow worms, grass snakes and common lizards . The huge wildlife, which was sparked by arsonists, has destroyed an area of heathland the size of a hundred football pitches in Dorset . But 350 miles away, it looked more like Christmas as a coating of snow caused a headache for unprepared commuters yesterday morning. Residents of Northumberland, Cumbria and County Durham were expecting April showers but the region’s highlands were instead blanketed in a freezing flurry. Lowson Robinson, who has been working on a model village in his garden in Cumbria for more than ten years, said: ‘The village looks lovely in the snow. There was a little flurry yesterday but I didn’t expect it to lie.’ The retired coal miner, 67, added: ‘It’s snowing today and I think it might continue until the weekend but then that should be it for the year. The weather here can get pretty bad and we get a lot of snow so it’s hard to tell but spring should be just around the corner.’ Yesterday, forecasters said there is a risk of rain across the country for the rest of the week and it will continue to be a bit colder than the seasonal average. In the south, temperatures could fall to -1C (30F). John Griffiths of MeteoGroup said: ‘Easter Sunday and Monday should be drier and brighter with sunny spells.’ Fire crews spent most of yesterday battling to bring the blaze under control and officers spent last night dampening the area down and returned today to ensure to fire didn't reignite . Experts say thousands of the creatures will have been killed by the blaze. Some 50 wildlife volunteers spent today rescuing reptiles that survived by burrowing into deep ground.

Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion during the Royals' FA Cup 3-0 quarter-final replay win over Bradford City last month. Sumner, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch - landing on his back, before being tackled by stewards. Reading fan Charlie Sumner (left) faces a three-year football ban after his one-man pitch invasion last month . Sumner - who said going to his first game was a 'brilliant experience' - is now facing a potential three-year ban for carrying out the stunt. The order, due to be decided on April 30, would stop him going to all of Reading's future home and away matches. On Wednesday, Sumner, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said he had no regrets about the incident, adding that he had done it for 'laugh' and that his family had 'seen the funny side'. Speaking outside court, he said: 'After doing it and seeing good comments and messages, even from the away fans, I don't look back and regret it. The incident occurred during the Royals' 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final replay win over Bradford . 'Obviously I wouldn't inform other people to do it. It was just spur of the moment. It's good to see good feedback and not negative feedback. 'I'd had a few drinks, I was happy and Reading were winning and I just went for it and had a laugh. It was brilliant.' Asked whether he goes to many Reading matches, he added: 'That was my first game actually. It was a good experience. Obviously being there on the first game - not after what I've done, but standing in the stadium, watching the game from the stadium - it's a brilliant experience. 'Obviously with the ban, I wouldn't be able to experience that experience again.' The incident took place on March 16, when the match was being broadcast live to millions of viewers on BBC One. Afterwards, footage of Sumner's antics also went viral on the internet. Despite facing a potential banning order  Sumner was in good spirits outside Reading Magistrates' Court . Sumner, who went to the match with a group of eight friends, said he spoke to them in a taxi on the way to the match about potentially running on to the pitch. 'I did say no at first. Then Reading were winning and I got a bit excited,' he said. 'I went to rave on Friday and there's another video on Facebook and I'm doing flips there. I've had a few selfies, a few drinks bought for me.' But Sumner, who works as a dry liner fixing ceilings, said he thought a potential football banning order 'seemed a bit much.' After running on to the pitch, Sumner (centre) was tackled by stewards and footage of his antics went viral . 'I don't want a three-year ban because obviously it's quite a bit,' he said. 'I'm not encouraging people do it and if I go to another game, I'm not going to do it again.' At Wednesday's hearing, Sumner's solicitor entered a guilty plea on his client's behalf to one count of going on to a playing area at a football match under the Football Offences Act 1991. Sumner, who was at court but missed his hearing after leaving the building briefly, was released on bail with conditions that he does not attend Reading's home or away matches. He will appear at Reading Magistrates' Court on April 30 when a decision will be made on whether he receives a football banning order. Sumner (centre) said he spoke to friends on the way to the stadium about the stunt and has no regrets .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"The worry for Virgil van Dijk is obvious. Holland’s national team have already conceded more goals in five Euro 2016 qualifiers than they lost in the entire qualifying campaign for the last World Cup. And still Guus Hiddink never calls or writes. The Celtic defender made it into two squads last year. But one step forward is usually followed by two steps back. When the Dutch were drawing 1-1 with Turkey the other night he was sunning himself in the Arabian Gulf and bumping into club-mates instead. Virgil van Dijk has been in fine form for Celtic but wasn't rewarded with a call-up to the Holland national team . Van Dijk's last call-up to the Dutch side came last year though he has never been capped by his country . ‘I saw Stuart Armstrong and Callum McGregor,’ he says in deadpan fashion. ‘The better players were with their national teams. I was in Dubai.’ A holiday in Dubai is rarely a cause of self-pity. Yet van Dijk’s gripe is obvious. His breakthrough to the national squad was short-lived and he can’t shake the nagging belief that he might have a better chance of playing for his country if he performed in a more respected league than the SPFL. Celtic boss Ronny Deila denies this, using Jason Denayer’s Belgium debut against Israel by way of a counter argument. ‘I don’t think the Belgian national team is any worse than the Dutch,’ he insists. ‘Right now, it is better. So I don’t think that is the answer. ‘I don’t know the level of the other central defenders in Holland, but they must be very, very good to be better than Virgil, in my opinion.’ Van Dijk’s rivals for Hiddink’s attentions are Stefan de Vrij, Bruno Martins Indi, Jeffrey Bruma and Joel Veltman. None are superstars. But they play in Italy, Portugal or Holland. All three leagues have a better reputation than the SPFL and the worry for Celtic is that van Dijk knows it. Van Dijk says he was happy for team-mate Jason Denayer, \\xa0who made his debut for Belgium against Israel . ‘Yes, I think that’s maybe one of the big reasons,’ says the defender. ‘They don’t take the (Scottish) league too serious. I don’t know what the reason is, but until then I just need to keep working and hopefully get a call-up. ‘Nobody asks the manager (Hiddink) or his staff either why I’m not getting a call-up. For me, the only thing I can do is play well for Celtic, work hard and prove myself day in and day out. ‘I’ve watched most of the games, including the highlights from the Turkey game last week. Sometimes you hope you get a chance. But until that day will come, it’s just for me to work hard and win games for Celtic and prove myself. ‘If I’m in the national team it would be a big bonus because it’s only like last season that I’ve been playing okay and I’ve tried to continue that this season. If I get a call-up then great.’ Through any disappointment he could find a silver lining in being overlooked once more. ‘It was a little bit disappointing when the squad was announced,’ he concedes. ‘But the day I knew I was getting a week off was a better day, I think. ‘My feeling is I needed this break a lot. I’ve never played so many games in a season as I have this year so far and the travelling is also quite hard at time, mentally. ‘I needed a nice break with the family away to get some rest and to be ready for Friday. I’ve been to Dubai and got some nice sun and relaxation.’ Ronny Deila believes the standard of Scottish football makes no difference to Holland's decision-making . There is no envy of his friend and defensive partner Jason Denayer. The 20-year-old was called into the fray for Belgium after Vincent Kompany was sent off in midweek, playing half an hour for his homeland. ‘I’m very happy for him,’ insists van Dijk. ‘He is a good friend of mine now and I’m very happy he made his debut. It was a good day for him.’ Whether either player will still be at Celtic next season is impossible to say. Van Dijk plays questions with a straight bat. As all footballers must, he insists he thinks little of transfer matters so long as there are trophies to play for. ‘I speak to my agent almost daily,’ he reveals. ‘But he’s more than an agent to me, he’s also become a very good friend. ‘He knows exactly what I want and what I don’t want to hear. So, we have a very good relationship and that remains that way. ‘I don’t think about all that at the moment, not at all. I think about the Treble. ‘We have one cup now and the other two are close, so I want to win both of them and write some history. That’s all I’m thinking about. I’m not thinking about this is going to be my last season at the club or anything else.’ Van Dijk leaves the field after being sent off against Inter Milan in the Europa League in February . Like van Dijk, his coach Deila also took a holiday ahead of Friday night’s clash with St Mirren in Paisley and the final stretch of the domestic season. ‘I was in Marbella for a week, 25 degrees in the sun,’ says the Norwegian. ‘So that was good. I needed that. ‘I switched off. It was a good week. Of course you are always thinking a little bit and watching the international teams, what’s happening there, but it was a very, very good week. ‘I’m ready now and looking forward to Friday. ‘It’s our possibility to take some days off - because during the season you play three times a week so there’s never a chance to do anything. When we have international team breaks, we have 70 per cent of the squad away on duty. It’s good to use those periods.’\",\n",

The Chelsea midfielder struggled to make an impact in midfield as the European champions fell to defeat . After a brilliant start to the season at Stamford Bridge, the Spaniard's form has dropped off somewhat of late . 'I'm playing almost every minute of every match (with Chelsea) and that's what makes me happy,' he said this week. But a long, intense campaign on his return to England is taking its toll on the Spaniard. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the Amsterdam ArenA, adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the Blues' title charge decline of late. Fabregas captained the European champions in the Dutch capital but struggled to make any real impact against Manchester United's Daley Blind or goalscorer\\xa0Davy Klaassen. Jose Mourinho will be demanding more from his deep-lying playmaker in the Premier League run-in . Diego Costa and Fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in Chelsea's 3-2 win at Hull City . Fabregas was brilliant for Chelsea in their big win away at Swansea City in January but has struggled since . After his £30million transfer to Chelsea last summer, Fabregas' former club Barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-Christmas slump. 'There has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club,' it read. 'Despite glowing starts to each campaign, Cesc's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close. 'From being someone who joined in with the attack, supplying and scoring goals, the magic tended to fade later on in each season.' And it seems to have rung true on the stats front. Having picked up 15 Premier League assists by mid-January, he has just one in five games he has played since, and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015. Thierry Henry's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form, Fabregas is now on track to fall just short. However, with nine games to play Chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against. Fabregas' former team-mate Thierry Henry (right) holds the record for assists in a Premier League season . Henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and Fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump . When he left Barcelona, the  club commented on Fabregas' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump . Their opponents on Saturday, Stoke City, as well as Queens Park Rangers, Manchester United, Arsenal, Leicester City and West Bromwich Albion have all been opened up by Fabregas' passing ability this season, while he scored in Chelsea's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in October. The personal accolade will be important to the midfielder, but more key is the boost it could give to his club. Chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games, and if Fabregas finds form again the Premier League title could be wrapped up within weeks. Mourinho will hope his assist for Diego Costa in Chelsea's last game against Hull City is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong. Fabregas laid on an assist for Costa in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull City, but that was his first in five games . Mourinho is looking to guide his team over the line in the Premier League title race, with Fabregas a key cog .\",\n",

A veteran of the Iraq war stole thousands of pounds from a children's football club and spent the money on a stag trip to Las Vegas. Lance Corporal Riki Hughes has been jailed for 16 months after he plundered the accounts of Tidworth Town Football Club, where he volunteered as club secretary. He claimed to be making rent payments to the club's landlord - even though the team was actually getting its property for free. Hughes, 31, spent the money on himself, including camping equipment and a stag holiday to Las Vegas, Salisbury Crown Court heard. The former soldier, who served two tours in Iraq, pleaded guilty to stealing £17,000, but the club claimed that the total theft amounted to £26,000. He made out 70 bogus rent payments to an account he'd set up in the name of landlord Aspire Defence, which was not charging the club rent. Judge Andrew Barnett said: 'For two years you milked the funds of that football club, set up principally for those involved in the services and their children. 'You in effect treated a great deal of club money as your own. It was spent on personal luxuries. That's a disgraceful thing to do.' Hughes, from Andover in Hampshire, has been working as a telecoms engineer since he left the Army. Holiday: Hughes spent the money on a stag holiday in Las Vegas, pictured, and camping equipment .

Having beaten Denmark and Azerbaijan in their opening Elite Round qualifiers, the Young Lions had to beat France in Saint-Lo to advance to July's finals in Greece . But goals from Sehrou Guirassy and Gnaly Cornet put the hosts in command and a late response from Fulham's Patrick Roberts wasn't enough to rescue Sean O'Driscoll's team. Patrick Roberts was on target for England's Young Lions against France but it wasn't enough to qualify . Boosted by the return of Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Harry Winks from suspension, O'Driscoll reverted to the line-up that had beaten Denmark 3-2 late last week. A swirling wind in Normandy made playing conditions difficult, with any long balls ineffective, and consequently the first period saw very few chances. France managed to take one of theirs, however, just after the half-hour mark. Neal Maupay fired the ball into a crowded penalty area and Guirassy had the presence of mind to divert it past England goalkeeper Angus Gunn. Chelsea' Izzy Brown came close to equalising shortly before half-time but sent Demarai Gray's cross over the bar inside the six-yard box. Sean O'Driscoll's team have missed out on this summer's European Championship finals in Greece . France's second goal, five minutes into the second half, left England with a mountain to climb.

              " {'sequence': \"It may not be as fast as a Ferrari or as regal as a Rolls Royce but the most popular type of car in the world is 50 years old this year as the humble hatchback hits its half century. The car shape originally designed to help French farmers transport their sheep to market now accounts for a staggering two in every three cars sold in the UK. And it is just as popular across the world from Munich to Mexico City thanks to its practical design, economy and comfort. The model credited with being the world’s first ever hatchback was the\\xa0Renault 16 unveiled in April 1965 . The Renault 4: the forerunner to the Renault 16 was first designed to allow French farmers to transport sheep . The model credited with being the world’s first ever hatchback was unveiled to the public with the launch of France’s Renault 16 in April 1965. Now it accounts for a staggering two thirds of all new cars sold in Britain and a majority of those sold in most other markets from Europe to Japan and, increasingly, the US too. In the UK, seven of the top ten sellers last year - including the top five - are classed as hatchbacks. This is defined as a car which has a boot that lifts up from the roof but the outline of the car is no bigger than if it were a standard saloon (so estate cars and 4x4s are not classed as hatchbacks for instance.) Yet when the first one went on sale in 1965, the name hatchback did not even exist. It only came into use in the 70s as an alternative to the American term ‘liftback’ for such cars. The Renault 16 was the first mass produced hatchback in the world. It was described by then Renault president Pierre Dreyfus as a ‘voiture a vivre’ - a car for every aspect of life. Britain’s answer to the pioneering Renault \\xa0was the very similar looking, but poorly built, Austin Maxi (pictured) The very popular Austin Mini Metro by Austin Rover was launched in 1980 and then relaunched in 1995 . Like the earlier Renault 4, the boot was hinged to the roof but unlike the R4, the chassis had not been extended to facilitate this. There had been clique luxury cars with a similar boot but the R16 was revolutionary for a mass produced car with a hatch at the back and seats which folded down. And it became the first time cars were called either ‘three door’ or ‘five door.’ The Ford focus the world's best selling nameplate . Not only is the Ford Focus the word's best selling hatchback but also the best selling automobile nameplate in the world. Ford began sales of the Focus to Europe in July 1998 and in North America during 1999. In 2010 Ford decided to reunite both international and North American models by releasing the international Mk3 worldwide. The previous North American version was discontinued, and the new model was launched simultaneously in North America and Europe in early 2011. As of the first half of 2012, the Focus surpassed the Toyota Camri as the world's best-seller . Renault celebrated the car’s 50th anniversary with a retrospective exhibition in Paris this week. It said: “The goal was to design a high-end mid-sized car that would set itself completely apart from the opposition: a family car adapted to every aspect of modern life, boasting the functionality and versatility of an estate while delivering the comfort and elegance of a saloon car.” The car was a critical and commercial success leading to generations of copycat rivals. Better rivals came from Japan - the Nissan Sunny (pictured) along with the Honda Civic and the Toyota Camry . Britain’s answer to it was the very similar looking, but poorly built, Austin Maxi. It was so poor that even the factory workers at the time were reluctant to use their company discount to own one. Better rivals came from Japan - the Nissan Sunny, Honda Civic and the Toyota Camry which became one of the world’s best selling cars of the 70s. The Germans followed with the Opel Kadett, which later became the Vauxhall Astra and the early VW Passat, a forerunner to the massively successful VW Golf. The VW Golf GTI and the Ford Escort XR3i from the golden age of the hatchback as a cult car . Ford brought out its own bestseller, the Fiesta and Fiat launched the Uno. European motorists snapped up hatchbacks by the million. America took longer to get the hatchback bug. Cheap petrol and a love of gas guzzling motors and pick ups meant they were reluctant to change at first. Gradually throughout the 1970s, most major manufacturers began to bring out hatchback versions of existing saloons, like the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Cavalier.

The nation's Maruti 800 has sold 2.66 million since 1983. What Car? editor, Jim Holder, said: “At What Car?, we see every day how the popularity of the hatchback both endures and increases. “For a vast majority of buyers the added practicality offered by a hatchback is a necessity, and despite the rise in sales of supposedly more upmarket saloons we see no reason for that trend to change.” Of 2.26 million cars sold in the UK last year, 1.5 million were hatchbacks. Of the top ten best sellers, the top five were hatchbacks - the Fiesta and Focus from Ford, the Corsa and Astra by Vauxhall and the VW Golf. The VW Polo is seventh in the table and the Audi A3 is eighth. The What Car? Car of the Year for 2015 was a hatchback, the new Skoda Fabia (pictured)\",\n",

Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist.

Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott . Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final . Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year . 'I think it's fantastic to make that decision to bow out of Super League probably at the right time,' Smith added. 'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage. 'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right. I'm no expert on when other people should retire but I'm pleased for Kevin and he'll certainly give everything he's got to his new employers. 'That's how he's been in rugby league and I've got no reason to think it'll be any different.' Sinfield has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of Jason Robinson, Andy Farrell and Sam Burgess. 'Ideally I'd like to play fly-half,' Sinfield said. 'It's the position that suits the skill set I have the best. Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge . 'I understand the challenge that's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over. That's why I think I'm in the best possible place to help with that transition. 'Playing union is something I've always wanted to do. I didn't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities. When this opportunity came up I knew it was the right thing. 'I'm excited by it. I know the potential at the club and it's something I'd like to be a part of. 'I'm very respectful of the game and I like watching it. I think a lot of rugby league people look down on rugby union, and I think a lot of rugby union people look down on rugby league. But I like both games. As a sportsman, to get the opportunity to play another professional sport is something that really appeals to me.'\",\n",

Mr Dodd, who is a chemistry student in Middlesbrough, moved away with his family before Miss Purdham\\'s transition . \\'Now he had really grown into a handsome young man and I was very attracted to him right from the start – plus I had that feeling that he was also liking me too. “We sat talking for ages about the old days and then suddenly, he kissed me - and it felt like the right thing to do.\\' They began dating, with Mr Dodd eager to understand more about his new girlfriend\\'s transformation. \\'He was curious about it all of course and a little afraid, I think. It was all new to him and the fact that I had been a boy and we had been so close at one time was a little difficult to get his head around. \\'But he never ever treats me little anything less than the woman I am and he’s very respectful of me.\\' They are now engaged and are planning a family, with Miss Purdham having frozen her sperm before undergoing gender reassignment surgery. \\'We are so excited for our future. I still can’t believe that all this is happening – and that Christopher has fallen in love with me given our backgrounds. \\'I feel very lucky that fate crossed our paths again.

              " {'sequence': \"It is still Der Klassiker - but not quite as we know it. The fierce rivalry between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund has dominated German football for much of the past decade, reaching its crescendo when the two titans met in the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley. For a while, Der Klassiker represented the pinnacle of European football. Briefly, it carried as much relevance on the continental stage as El Clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid - maybe even more. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Borussia Dortmund looks dejected after Robert Lewandowski of Bayern Munich scored an equaliser during Der Klassiker between the teams at the Allianz Arena in November . Arjen Robben eventually grabbed the winner five minutes from time as Bayern defeated Dortmund 2-1 . Former Dortmund striker Lewandowski (left) battles with defender Mats Hummels during the recent Bundesliga clash at the Allianz Arena . But as these two prepare to meet in front of an 80,000 audience at the Signal Iduna Park on Saturday evening, some of that lustre has been lost. There is something unsettling about Bayern and Borussia being separated by nine Bundesliga places and a whopping 31 points. It just doesn't seem right, they should be No 1 and No 2. It feels very weird that nothing is riding on the outcome, at least so far as the title race is concerned. A Bayern win will confirm what we already know, that they will be champions for a third successive season. Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben scores past Borussia Dortmund's goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller during the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley Stadium . Bayern Munich defeated Borussia Dortmund 2-1 at Wembley to win the Champions League - a period in which Der Klassiker was one of the highlights on the European football calendar . A Dortmund win would make a little dent in Bayern's 10-point lead but isn't likely to derail their serene progress to retaining the shield. It would, however, boost their hopes of qualifying for Europe. Therein lies the problem - these two have experienced contrasting seasons in the extreme, to the point where the transferable Klassiker tag could soon be applied to another fixture - perhaps Bayern vs Wolfsburg or Bayern vs Monchengladbach. Having been rock-bottom at the beginning of February, Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund embarked on a seven-match unbeaten run, winning five, and could salvage a modicum of respectability from a disastrous season - and perhaps offset a summer exodus of their best players - by finishing in the top six. Mario Gotze celebrates scoring for Borussia Dortmund with Robert Lewandowski in their 1-0 win at Bayern Munich in November 2011 - both have since joined Bayern as Dortmund have slipped down the table . For Klopp, whose reputation around Europe has taken a battering this season, insists that Der Klassiker is still as significant as ever. 'We've got to try to beat Bayern and where that can take us in the league is secondary,' he said. Gotze refuses to celebrate after scoring for Bayern Munich against Dortmund in November 2013 . 'Although we're 10th, and although there's a huge points gap between us, and although a lot is different compared to the past, it's still a Borussia Dortmund home game. 'I don't recall us gifting any of these games in the past. Gladbach have shown us how it's done. Wolfsburg have also beaten them, but it's not all that easy.' Dortmund do have positive recent memories in this fixture to draw upon. They won 3-0 at the Allianz Arena at the tail end of last season, for example, though it came far too late to alter the destination of the title, which Bayern won by 19 points. They completed the double over their rivals en route to winning their back-to-back Bundesligas in 2010-2011 and 2011-2012. But those great moments seem a long time ago now and the fixture is harder to hype without so much riding on it. Another source of optimism for Klopp is Bayern's mounting injury list, with winger Franck Ribery, who has a recurring ankle problem, joining Arjen Robben and David Alaba on the sidelines. Not that club chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was panicking: 'We cannot change it and it would be a mistake if Bayern started to lament now.' Quite understandable. Another thrilling climax to the season awaits for Pep Guardiola and his team - they are coasting to a 25th championship, travel to Bayer Leverkusen in the last eight of the DFB-Pokal and Porto in the same stage of the Champions League. Another Treble looms for this all-conquering side. And, for a change, Dortmund are in no position to affect that.\",\n",

He was born in Maverley, Kingston, a tough Jamaican community where gun crime is rife and drug gangs rule, before moving across the Atlantic aged five to join his mother Nadine in north London along with three siblings. Living on the St Raphael’s estate meant the sounds of gunshots were never far away. Police labelled the adjoining Stonebridge estate a warzone in 2005. Rival gangs engaged in tit-for-tat shootings. ‘They were all dealing in crack cocaine and it was a fight for territory,’ said Detective Inspector Stephen Horsley in 2009.

The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility.

'I would like people to look past that and be like, oh she's just one of us.' Dayna says she wanted to turn any negativity that might be held over her disability into something positive and hopefully inspire others, or at the very least raise a smile. 'When I was first diagnosed with cerebral palsy, doctors warned my parents that I may never walk, but here I am dancing! I drive, I go to college, I do things like every other 19-year-old,' she says. The teen has now begun to do some motivational speaking at a couple of local schools. Confident: Dayna has now taken up motivational speaking and has visited several schools in the Chicago area .\",\n",

In a double hit for thousands of holidaymakers trying to leave Britain today, strikes by French air traffic controllers and new border control checks threaten severe delays. Air passengers face up to three days of disruption, with British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair and Flybe among the airlines forced to cancel dozens of flights. Scroll down for video . Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Chaos: New passport regulations could cause queues on roads leading to Dover and Folkestone (file photo) And those travelling abroad by ferry or Eurotunnel face queues as exit checks are introduced at Britain’s ports. The change, which takes effect from today, means every passenger in a car or coach will have their passport scanned. The walkout by France’s biggest air traffic controllers’ union SNCTA will begin at 5am today and run until 5am on Friday – with vast knock-on disruption expected. Last night, easyJet, which flies to more than a dozen French cities, said it was cancelling 118 flights, including ten directly affecting the UK. BA warned of ‘significant disruption’ and apologised for the cancellation of around a dozen return flights from Britain. Flybe said it was cancelling 16 of today’s flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Crush: Passengers travelling on the Channel Tunnel or on cross-Channel ferries are likely to see the worst of the disruption (file photo) Ryanair said it was cancelling 250 of today’s flights, with more likely, branding the strike ‘grossly unfair’. Nearly a third involve the UK, although many are destinations outside of France hit by the knock-on effect. A Ryanair spokesman said all affected customers have been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options – full refund, free transfer on to the next available flight or free transfer on to an alternatively routed flight. The Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation because industrial action is classed as an ‘unforeseen circumstance’ outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. In response to dire warnings that the introduction of border control checks would cause chaos, ministers have tried to lessen the impact by phasing the new rules in. For the first month, all passports will be scanned but only a quarter of passport holders will have to have their details verified. By June, this will rise to 100 per cent . Forget Rome or Athens, the best place to bask in spring sunshine this week will be Britain. The glorious weather is set to stretch out for the rest of the week – with hotter temperatures here than in many Mediterranean destinations. The mercury is set to rise steadily until Friday, when southern parts of England are forecast to hit 21C (70F) or higher, which would be the hottest temperature here so far this year. Rome and Athens are only expected to reach 16C (61F), while Marseille is set to stall at 18C (65F). But make the most of it when you can as last week’s cooler weather is predicted to return on Sunday. Dan Williams, spokesman for the Met Office, said: ‘We are looking at high temperatures until the weekend. It will be cooler and breezier over the weekend with some rain. That will make way for more unsettled weather into next week.’',\n",

He trains Shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy, the record-breaking Jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys' championship and retire. McCoy has not decided yet whether he is riding Shutthefrontdoor in the £1million Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on  April 11, but everything points to him doing so. Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey AP McCoy rides\\xa0Shutthefrontdoor to Grand National success later this month . O'Neill told Betfred: 'Shutthefrontdoor is in great form. I could not be happier with him. I would have liked to have got a run into him (before the Grand National) but he had an abscess on his sinus in January/February time which took a while to find out where it was. 'We did think about giving him at run at Cheltenham (at the Festival in March) but decided not to. I think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly I did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he wasn't as well as he is now. He is schooling well and is spot on. 'He is a clean-winded horse, who is not hard to get ready. He was ready to run and win first time out at Carlisle. He is going to Aintree fresh and well. It is all down to AP now if he is going ride him. 'You need to have a good classy horse for the National. Before, you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck, now it is a proper race. Aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class. 'He likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan. If he got luck in running over the first mile, I would ride him myself. 'I don't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - I am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at Stratford or whatever! This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season . 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 . 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11). 'Holywell will run in the Betfred Bowl (April 9) after a great run (fourth) in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit. He put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home. 'He came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [Wednesday] morning. He came alive there last year and seems to like the track.'\",\n",

Cambiasso refuses to give up and admits that keeping Leicester up will feel like winning a trophy. Esteban Cambiasso says that helping keep Leicester in the Premier League will feel like winning a trophy . 'For me, it's like another cup,' he told BBC East Midlands Today. 'When you start another season you have an objective, and this is the objective for us. 'For me, winning a cup or winning the league with another team is the same now as having the possibility to save Leicester in the Premier League.' The Argentinian midfielder poses with the trophy after his team won the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup . Cambiasso had an illustrious career at Inter Milan, winning an impressive 15 trophies during his stint . River Plate (2001-2002) Argentine Primera Division . Real Madrid (2002-2004) La Liga .

              " {'sequence': \"Defender Daryl Janmaat has admitted Newcastle got exactly what they deserved from their derby trip to Sunderland - nothing. The 25-year-old Holland full-back played the full 90 minutes of Sunday's 1-0 Barclays Premier League defeat at the Stadium of Light despite suffering a suspected tear in his calf muscle during the warm-up, but was unable to prevent the Black Cats running out winners as the Magpies slipped to a record fifth successive defeat in the fixture. Newcastle created little of note on another poor day for John Carver's men, and Janmaat was pulling no punches as he assessed the fall-out. Daryl Janmaat (left) has admitted that Newcastle United's performance in their Tyne-Wear derby against Sunderland wasn't good enough and they got exactly what they deserved - nothing . The Holland full-back played the full 90 minutes despite a suspected calf muscle tear . Janmaat tries to get across and stop a cross from Sunderland's Steven Fletcher at the Stadium of Light . He told NUFCTV: 'It was not good enough. The first half was really poor, we were too negative, so it was not good enough. The second half was much better, but it still wasn't good enough. 'I wouldn't say we didn't give everything. What I can say is we were not good enough and everybody saw that Sunderland were better, especially in the first half. 'If you are not good enough, then most of the time, you lose.' Newcastle were simply not at the races as a Sunderland side motivated by new head coach Dick Advocaat dominated from the off, although they looked like making it to half-time unharmed before Jermain Defoe smashed home a stoppage-time volley which proved to be the tangible difference between the teams. Janmaat said: 'A goal in the last minute of the first half, it's always hard to concede it because you go into the dressing room with a bad feeling. If you go in at 0-0, you can be positive in the dressing room, but if you concede a goal in the 47th minute, then it's hard. Jermain Defoe scored the winning goal - a spectacular volley - on the stroke of half-time . Defoe's goal proved to be ample reward for Sunderland's dominance in the Tyne-Wear derby . The result moves Sunderland three points clear of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone . April 13 Liverpool (A) April 19 Tottenham Hotspur (H) April 25 Swansea City (H) May 2 Leicester City (A) May 9 West Bromwich Albion (H) May 16 Queens Park Rangers (A) May 24 West Ham (H) 'But they deserved to score in the first half because they had maybe 20 free-kicks and they were better than us, then normally you score a goal. Like I said, it was not good enough.' Defeat was greeted with fury by frustrated fans who have now seen Sunderland take 17 of the 21 points on offer in the last seven derby encounters. Indeed, the Black Cats have won just 17 of their last 75 league games, five of them against their neighbours, a statistic which provides a damning indictment of Newcastle's lack of progress on the field. The Magpies last week reported profits of £18.7million at a time when its recruitment policy has once again come under close scrutiny. Carver went into Sunday's game with only one recognised central defender and right-back Janmaat having to play in the middle with midfielders Ryan Taylor and Jack Colback operating as full-backs, and he was also without a proven Premier League striker in the 18. Newcastle United manager John Carver had to cope with a weakened defence following injuries . Janmaat gets stuck into a challenge with Sunderland's Steven Fletcher during the derby match . That selection crisis was due in part to suspensions for Fabricio Coloccini and Papiss Cisse and injuries to Steven Taylor, Paul Dummett and Massadio Haidara, as well as midfielders Cheick Tiote, Siem de Jong and Rolando Aarons, a casualty list which has served to expose the lack of depth in a squad assembled on a budget and made up largely of players sold a move to St James' Park as a stepping stone to bigger things. Owner Mike Ashley's tight financial constraints mean where the Magpies were once able to compete for big names - it was they who sparked the bidding war which ultimately led to Wayne Rooney's move to Manchester United from Everton in 2004 - they are now unwilling to do so even with clubs of a similar or lesser stature, and as a result, less able to do so on the pitch. Newcastle have made no secret of their view that the domestic cup competitions are unimportant, and European qualification very nearly ended in disaster during the 2012-13 campaign. Mid-table Premier League status and financial self-sufficiency remain the stated dual focus and as a result, disenchantment on the terraces has reached epidemic levels. It is against that backdrop that Carver is attempting to prove he is the man to replace Alan Pardew at the helm, but a run of two wins from 13 games represents a less than impressive audition despite the mitigating factors.\",\n",

The 35-year-old veteran would rather be known for his golf than what he\\'s had to overcome to earn a spot in the field. But Compton isn\\'t shy about sharing his story, either. Erik Compton shares a joke with Jim Furyk during a practice round at Augusta ahead of the Masters . A first heart transplant at 12, then a second in 2008 after a major heart attack - what doctors call a \\'widow-maker\\' - while driving home from a lesson with longtime coach and close pal Charlie DeLucca. He\\'s been trying make up for lost time ever since. \\'It\\'s hard, but it\\'s also a great thing,\\' Compton said on Monday after a practice round at Augusta National. \\'There\\'s two sides to me. I\\'m a competitor and a sports person, and I\\'m also the recipient of two transplants, and I know what that involves. So when you put them together, it does make a little bit of spaghetti in my mind sometimes you know.\\' \\'I\\'ll take it,\\' he added a moment later. It\\'s not like Compton had a choice. He recovered from his childhood setback to become the No 1-ranked junior in the United States at 18, then a two-time All-American at Georgia. Compton, 35, is set to make his first appearance at the famous tournament this week . But he\\'s spent most of the intervening years battling on minor league circuits, then becoming an advocate and spokesman for Donate Life, an alliance for national and local groups raising awareness about organ and tissue donation. In a nice bit of serendipity, his first appearance in the Masters coincides with Donate Life Month. But it\\'s already a full-time campaign for Compton - he\\'s been displaying the organization\\'s logo on his shirt sleeve for a while. All of those efforts paid big dividends last year, when he carved out a spot on the PGA Tour and nearly stole the show at the US Open. His runner-up finish at Pinehurst nudged Compton and his story into the spotlight - and earned him an invitation to Augusta. It was something he\\'d longed to do since watching the tournament on TV as a kid. \\'For me, it was a bit difficult to watch so many years and think, I\\'m never going to play in the Masters, just because of other issues that I\\'ve had. But yet, I just love to watch the Masters. So it\\'s going to be weird,\\' he said to laughter, \\'not watching the Masters this year.\\' Compton\\'s wife, Barbara, and parents Peter and Eli won\\'t be tuning in this year, either, making the drive up from Florida to watch Erik play in person. It\\'s a well-deserved reward to be sure, since all of them had a hand in the push-pull climb toward the top of the golf hill. The veteran has had two heart transplants, but wants to focus on the week ahead, rather than his journey . After walking most his son\\'s practice round, Peter Compton recalled how motivated Erik was, no matter how tough things seemed. Six months after Hurricane Andrew hit the Miami area in 1992, forcing the family out of their home and into temporary housing alongside a golf course near Doral, he took his son to play a few holes. \\'We were in a cart and back then, he liked driving more than playing,\\' Peter recalled. \\'But every time we\\'d leave the tee, he\\'d drive to his ball, and he was already hitting it 225 (yards) or so. So finally, about the third time it happened, I had to remind him, \"Hey, stop here. Let me play MY tee shots!\" \\'He started playing junior tournaments in the area after that and a lot of the fathers would come up and tell me what a terrific story it was,\\' Peter said. \\'But it wasn\\'t long after that Erik started winning those tournaments. ... He could have sat back, said he\\'d been dealt a bad hand and did nothing. So I think that\\'s what we\\'re most proud of - he refused to give up.\\' Compton chats with his caddie as he walks the famous course ahead of his first ever round at the Masters . Compton tries to strike a delicate balance between those accomplishments and his aspirations. After a promising 2014 campaign on the big tour, his breakthrough performance at Pinehurst - only the second major he qualified to play. But Compton struggled this year, opening the 2015 season with a tie for 10th. He then wrestled with his driver and missed the cut in his next five tournaments. At the moment, most of his energy and focus are devoted to keeping the ball in play . \\'I\\'m here in the press room at the Masters, and that\\'s a great thing,\\' he said. \\'But I don\\'t look at myself as somebody who is a role model ... I look at myself as a golfer who has used golf as a means to maybe put some of the tough stuff that\\'s happened to me in the past. Golf\\'s been very therapeutic for me over the years. \\'As I\\'m sitting here today,\\' Compton concluded, \\'I view myself as somebody who is going to try to do the best he can to compete in the Masters.\\'',\n",

              " {'sequence': \"From the moment Jack Johnson beat Tommy Burns to win the world heavyweight title in 1908, a frenzied search began. While Johnson's victory wouldn't raise an eyebrow nowadays, it caused consternation in America for one simple reason: Johnson was black — and a black man had never held sport's greatest prize. Racism was rife in America: black people were not supposed to rule over whites in any sphere of life. As the great boxing pundit Bert Sugar put it, 'This was the white man's crown. (To white America), it was as if the white man's slave had become his master.' After beating Tommy Burns in 1908, Jack Johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion . It is difficult to convey to a reader in 2015 the shockwaves that Johnson's victory caused. Even liberal newspapers, such as The New York Times, were openly hostile to the giant Texan. It mattered little that Johnson was American. His skin was deemed the wrong colour and a great cry went up from white America to find a white challenger — a 'Great White Hope' — who could unseat the new champion. But little did white America know that it would take over six years before Johnson would be defeated, on April 5, 1915, 100 years ago on Sunday. Most had believed Johnson would be dispatched quickly. However, he made short work of his first four title defences, his most notable victory coming over world middleweight champion Stanley Ketchel who made the massive step up in weight and even managed to knock Johnson down. Yet Johnson had been fighting in second gear until that point and, as soon as he returned to his feet, scored a brutal knockout, uprooting several of Ketchel's teeth in the process. Attention immediately turned to finding another 'white hope'. There seemed an obvious choice: former world heavyweight champion James J Jeffries, who had retired undefeated in 1904. Jeffries, who as champion had dodged Johnson, was seen as someone who could quickly defeat the title holder and return things to the way they were. Things didn't go as planned. Six years out of the ring had taken its toll on Jeffries and in 1910 Johnson stopped the former champion in 15 rounds, further enraging whites who rioted, taking out their anger on blacks who had the temerity to celebrate Johnson's win. As many as 26 black people would be killed by lynch mobs. What made Johnson even more unbearable to white America was the way he lived his life. A fun-loving character, Johnson dated and married white women, and refused to live according to the social norms of the time. He was intelligent, eloquent and ambitious and saw no reason why his being black should hold him back from doing whatever he wanted. American heavyweight boxer Jess Willard (left) with his manager Tom Jones in Havana, Cuba in April 1915 . Johnson loses his world heavyweight title to Willard (left) over the course of 26 rounds in Havana in 1915 . Like Muhammad Ali years later, he was a trailblazer. He suffered dreadful discrimination, death threats and later persecution at the hands of the government. He took most of it in his stride. The same cannot be said of his detractors whose efforts to unseat him became increasingly desperate. In 1912, one opponent, 'Fireman' Jim Flynn, was disqualified for repeatedly trying to headbutt Johnson. Things were getting ridiculous, but Johnson's life outside the ring was unravelling. He spent money like it grew on trees and was being investigated by the US government on the spurious charge of abducting his future second wife under what was known as the Mann Act, a dubious piece of legislation designed to prevent 'white slavery'. He was found guilty by an all-white jury and sentenced to a year in prison. Johnson had other ideas. He fled to Canada and then to Europe, fighting three times in Paris, where he made history by beating 'Battling' Jim Johnson in the first-ever all-black heavyweight championship bout. Next he outpointed American Frank Moran over 20 rounds, though the purses for the fight were frozen after a dispute. With his money running low and the First World War breaking out in Europe, he accepted the challenge of another 'white hope' from America. His name was Jess Willard, a 6ft 6in fighter, known as 'The Pottawatomie Giant.' To put Willard's size into perspective, the average height of an American man at the time was 5ft 7in. The fight would take place in Cuba and was scheduled for 45 three-minute rounds, a hell of a distance given the 40-degree heat on the day. How would Johnson, now 37, handle a challenger four years his junior? The champion had, quite arrogantly, barely trained for the fight. Still, Willard was certainly the underdog: his size meant he was not particularly agile and he did not like hurting opponents unless they had hurt him first. Johnson was supremely confident. Johnson dominated the opening 10 rounds but his lack of conditioning soon began to tell. His breathing became heavy, amid the sweltering heat, and Willard grew in confidence. The writing was on the wall at the end of round 25. Johnson, sat on his stool, called over fight promoter Jack Curley. 'Jack, go take my wife away...tell her I'm awful weak and I want her to leave.' In the next round Willard seized his chance. He faked to throw a left to the body and then swung a mighty overhand right that connected perfectly with Johnson's jaw. Johnson slumped to the canvas and took the count flat on his back. It was the victory that white America had been waiting for but was all as it seemed? Action from the world heavyweight title fight between Johnson and Willard in Havana, Cuba in 1915 . Photographs of the knockout appeared to show Johnson shielding his eyes from the sun and he would later claim this was because he had deliberately taken a fall. His motivation, Johnson said, was a $50,000 payout and a promise from the American authorities that he could finally return to his homeland without having to serve his prison sentence. Johnson's 'confession' was sold for a fee to Nat Fleischer, the respected founder of The Ring magazine. But Fleischer never believed Johnson, while Willard was bitter about Johnson's claim, especially as the victory was his finest hour. 'If he was going to throw the fight I wish he'd done it sooner,' Willard said. 'It was hotter than hell out there.' Much of the public believed Johnson and they had not seen the film of the contest as there was a ban on it being shown. It would take 40 years for the footage to see the light of day. When it did surface, Willard was vindicated, the film clearly showing him land a powerful blow. 'I've waited a long time but at last people are beginning to believe me when I say I that I beat Johnson fair and square.' Willard confronted Johnson over his claims in 1944. 'I asked him why he made his false statement,' Willard recalled. 'He just shrugged and gave me that gold-toothed smile of his. Jack knew and I knew he was lying. But the fella was desperate for money, so who could blame him.' Johnson would eventually end his exile and continue fighting into the 1930s. Tragically he would die in a car crash in 1946, speeding away from a diner that refused him service on account of his race. Willard would lose his world title in only his second defence, suffering an awful beating at the hands of Jack Dempsey before retiring to his farm in Kansas. Johnson was defeated after enduring 26 rounds in the sweltering Cuban heat, compared to 'hell'\",\n",

'They have brought through four or five players - Danny Rose as well - who are in the England squad and four players on the pitch at one time tonight is fantastic for the club and hopefully it can be an inspiration to the younger players, the likes of Josh Onomah and Harry Winks who are coming through, that they can be in the first team.'

              " {'sequence': \"A supporter waits the best part of an hour for five seconds with Ryan Taylor. There is a quick picture and good-luck message ahead of Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby. He is, evidently, one of the few players genuinely respected by Newcastle's disillusioned fans. Taylor scored the winner at the Stadium of Light three seasons ago, affording him a terrace tribute – 'Ryan Taylor, over the wall' – as well as a place in black-and-white folklore. But there is more to the Toon Army's admiration than one free-kick against the enemy. A working-class Scouser who came through the ranks at Tranmere and made 100 appearances by the time he was 21 before beating three career-threatening injuries, Taylor 'gets' the proud principles of the North East – appreciation, hard graft, honesty and enjoyment. He has himself been a fan in the crowd during three of the last four derby defeats - he watched the other from a hotel room in America after undergoing surgery on the second of the cruciate ligament injuries which kept him out for 26 months. Newcastle utility player Ryan Taylor (right) shields the ball from Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck . Taylor scores with a superb free-kick against Sunderland to win the game 1-0 at the Stadium of Light . Taylor is congratulated by Newcastle defender Steven Taylor  in the club's last victory over Sunderland . Newcastle supported him through that long rehabilitation, something for which Taylor will always be grateful. But with his current contract at St James' Park set to expire this summer, the 30-year-old does not know what the future holds. He would like to remain on Tyneside. He accepts, though, that this could be his final taste of the fixture which has guaranteed him lifelong worship. 'I have to be realistic, this could be my last derby,' he told Sportsmail. 'I don't want it to be, but that will be in my mind. So I'm not going to let it go the way of the last four - that cannot carry on. 'I've left the stadium gutted after every one of them and I've felt it like a fan. So we owe it to them now. 'I grew up with Liverpool and Everton, but that isn't as big because you live in the same house a lot of the time. 'So I'll be doing everything I can personally do to make sure we're up for it, because our performances in the last four just haven't been good enough.' Taylor returned after more than two years of painstaking gym sessions alone for October's 2-0 win at Manchester City in the League Cup. He was man-of-the-match and was greeted by a standing ovation in the dressing-room, where text messages from the likes of Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen awaited. Ninety minutes against the champions, however, had taken its toll. In the next game, at home to QPR, St James' was stunned into silence when, after half an hour, a tearful Taylor sat himself on the turf clutching the same ill-fated knee. Taylor's injury record at Newcastle has severely limited his first-team appearances over the past few years . The 30-year-old is incredibly grateful to Newcastle for sticking by him and hopes to repay them on Sunday . 'I thought to myself, 'Why me?',' he reflects. 'You start doubting whether the knee will ever be strong enough. I was thinking, 'What have I skipped? What have I done wrong?'. 'Within an hour of the game I'd had a scan and the cruciate was fine, relief isn't the word. I'd probably got through the City game on pure adrenaline. So I think it was my body telling me just take your time. 'I won't lie, the fact I'm out of contract was on my mind and I wanted to be back sooner than the three months it took. 'Every game felt like another game off my career. But we did what was right and now there are no problems at all. 'I'll admit there were times when I thought I couldn't do it and my old man just told me 'no'. 'So when you've had the tears and those dark days, you appreciate every minute.' On the subject of dark days, both Newcastle and Sunderland are horribly out of form going into what has been billed as 'The Desperation Derby'. The Black Cats could be in the relegation zone by the time kick-off arrives, while Newcastle have lost their last three under John Carver. To suffer another loss in the derby could prove unforgivable in the eyes of supporters whose last victory arrived courtesy of Taylor's right boot in August, 2011. 'The good thing is we've got a cracking game now and if anything can rally us for the rest of the season then this is it,' says Taylor, who will start at right back. 'To be on a winning team on the ground where it all started for me would make everything worthwhile, all of the hard work and long days during those two years. 'But I remember that day so well. It was my first derby. I've played in two now and I'm yet to lose. 'Jonas (Gutierrez) won a foul just on the corner of the box. My first Premier League goal – for Wigan against Newcastle – was from that exact position, so I fancied it. 'I remember seeing Simon Mignolet edging out, almost inviting me to put it in the top corner. That's what I did. Steven Taylor tried to claim it, but he was nowhere near it. He tried to celebrate my goal by himself! 'I knew my dad and brother were in the away end celebrating and I just thought, 'Wow. They will be having some time in there'. Taylor is one of the most popular players at Newcastle for his consistent and hard working performances . 'Dan Gosling – one of my best mates – went through on goal in the last minute. Looking back, I'm probably relieved he didn't score to make it 2-0! 'I didn't realise at the time how big scoring the winner was and how much I would be remembered for just one goal. 'It'll be amazing if I'm coming back here in 10 years' time with my two boys and they're still singing that song.' Taylor adds: 'I'll always be a Newcastle fan. This club has been brilliant with me. I could have been the forgotten man but they stuck by me. 'Now I need to show them that I can stay fit. I've had some terrible luck, but I'd like to think I've got a lot left in me. 'So this final part of the season is massive for me – I would love to stay here.' And with that the supporter has his photo. 'What's going to happen on Sunday?' Taylor is asked. '1-0. Ryan Taylor. Over the wall,' he laughs. You can see why they like him in these parts. Taylor is out of contract at the end of the season and admits he does not know what the future has in store .\",\n",

So many to choose from but given Augusta’s predilection for a tale of redemption — from Vijay ‘kiss my ass’ Singh to Adam ‘this one’s for you, Greg’ Scott — let’s go for the reformed party animal Dustin Johnson. Time for him to prove he can match his gargantuan yardage off the tee with the requisite amount of brain cells. Dustin Johnson watches his tee shot during a practice round on the Augusta course on Wednesday . Best European (Non-UK) Not so many to choose from, alas. Indeed, given Henrik Stenson spent a week in bed with flu recently and reckons his strength is still low, we’re almost empty-handed. Still, let’s hope the Swede can rise from his sick bed. Other than that, it’s time Victor Dubuisson returned to the limelight. Henrik Stenson has only recently recovered from flu but the Swede will be hoping to mount a serious challenge . Best from the UK . Let’s leave out the history man on the grounds he has his own category. Lee Westwood has got an impressive recent record at Augusta and Justin Rose has shown he can play well here. But I have a feeling Paul Casey is the most likely to join Rory and get into contention come Sunday afternoon. Best International . You can hardly have faith in Adam Scott to emulate Bubba Watson and win a second Masters in three years given he’s confused enough on the greens to be going back to the long putter. While Scott sorts himself out, compatriot Jason Day has an outstanding chance to grab another win for Australia. Jason Day has a great chance to become another Australian winner at the Masters . Best each way bet . When you think last year’s joint runner-up Jonas Blixt is 150-1, there are some tasty odds out there. How about Padraig Harrington at 80-1? Or Bernhard Langer to finish in the top six at 400-1? My particular favourite is three-time Masters champ Phil Mickelson at 25-1. A steal. Phil Mickelson watches his fairway shot on the 11th green during his practice round on Wednesday . How will Rory do? Given what it would do for the sport and what an achievement it would represent, I fervently hope Bubba Watson is slipping a size 38 regular jacket on to McIlroy’s shoulders come Sunday night. But this might prove the major where he falls just short — and we have to wait a couple of years to enjoy his Slam. Prediction: Third . Rory McIlroy will begin his quest for a Grand Slam when the Masters kicks into action on Thursday . How will Tiger do? Not as good as some American writers believe, who are fitting him up for his fifth green jacket already on the strength of shooting 33 for the front nine on a practice round on Monday. Not as bad as the doomsayers think either, though. He should make the halfway cut… and maybe scrape into the top 20. Prediction: 19th .

              " {'sequence': \"England star Anthony Watson believes the pain of Bath's European Champions Cup exit can be a driving force in their push to make this season's Aviva Premiership play-offs. Watson and company were left to reflect on what might have been at Dublin's Aviva Stadium as six Ian Madigan penalties gave three-time European champions Leinster a tense 18-15 quarter-final success. Bath dominated for large parts of the second period and claimed tries through fly-half George Ford and captain Stuart Hooper, but hopes of reaching a first top-flight European semi-final since 2006 floundered on their indiscipline. Anthony Watson carries during an impressive Bath performance, but the English side came up short . Attention will now quickly return to the Premiership, with Bath having four games left - against Newcastle, London Irish, Harlequins and Gloucester - in the quest for a top-four finish. 'The overriding emotion is that we are absolutely disappointed,' said Bath full-back Watson, whose counter-attacking brilliance was repeatedly showcased against an often stretched Leinster defence. 'To have battled out of the group as we did (Bath lost their first two games) and then obviously to get into the quarter-final, to get so close and then fail at the end, it is obviously massively disappointing. 'But we have to try to take the positives, and I think a disappointment like this is going to help us in the Premiership.' Bath stayed true to the ball-in-hand attacking principles that have lit up much of this season's Premiership campaign, and at times, Leinster struggled to cope. Ian Madigan was perfect from the tee to hand Leinster the victory in a game where they were second best . In Madigan, though, they had a relentless marksman, whose 100 per cent goalkicking return ultimately sent Leinster marching on and Bath left to focus solely on domestic matters. 'To put on an attacking performance and go through the phases like we did against a quality side like Leinster is just going to add more confidence,' Watson added. 'I think the way we have been playing this year has been a revelation to be a part of, and I have really enjoyed playing for this club. 'I think the progress we have made throughout the year has been awesome. I think the ethos and everything we are building at the club is going in the right direction.' Watson, meanwhile, paid tribute to his Bath and England team-mate Ford, who scored a brilliant solo try and made a darting break that set up Hooper for a second-half touchdown that meant the visitors were always in sight of their opponents on the scoreboard. It was a huge disappointment for Bath, but Watson hopes they can channel the pain to their league campaign . 'I cannot speak highly enough of him (Ford), to be honest,' Watson said. 'He is probably the best ball player I've played with, albeit in a short space of time of two or three years. 'He has got a very mature head on young shoulders, and it's a real privilege to play outside him.' Bath head coach Mike Ford could not mask his disappointment with the result, believing his team paid the price for an opening 40 minutes when they struggled for fluency and kept giving Madigan scoring chances. 'There is a lot of disappointment,' Ford said. 'The first-half performance, especially, we are a lot better than that. 'That last 10-15 minutes, I was pretty convinced we were going to win the game, but it's small margins. George Ford scored one try and created anotehr in a superb performance, but it wasn't enough . 'At half-time, we talked about composure. 'We hadn't been able to build any pressure with ball in hand, and there was also the discipline side of things. Madigan was pretty dead-eye, which cost us. 'We put it together second-half, and I think this will make us stronger. We will look back at the end of the season at this game, particularly, and say this is where Bath became very strong. 'I thought Anthony Watson was on fire at full-back, and George made two good breaks for our tries. It was in our control, we thought. Even at 15-5 down, we were confident we could win the game.' And Bath skipper Hooper said: 'When you get to this stage of the competition, it is about winning. 'The disappointment is two-fold. One is obviously losing the game and the other is probably the individual mistakes we made, particularly in the first half.'\",\n",

It might have been handy if someone had shared the message before they got off their bus in Swansea on Saturday. If Hull do go down, and their final fixtures suggest it is a distinct possibility, then this will be among the missed opportunities they regret the most. What a curious sight to see Steve Bruce’s players so lethargic, disinterested almost, in the first half against a side with nothing tangible to play for. Paul McShane scores against Swansea but Hull still fell to a 3-1 defeat at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Hull defender McShane is keeping faith that the Tigers will avoid relegation despite a tough run of games . Hull have only scored twice in their last six away games in the league. Stranger still when you consider their final seven games include fixtures against Southampton, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. They didn’t manage a shot on target until they were two goals behind and, as they did against Chelsea a fortnight ago, they waited until the game was almost out of sight before stringing a few passes together. That won’t cut it on this run-in and McShane, whose goal briefly had Hull in the game at 2-1, knows it. He said: ‘It’s like we need to go 2-0 down to get going and that’s not great from our point of view. Bafetimbi Gomis lifts the ball over Hull goalkeeper Allan McGregor to seal a 3-1 victory for Swansea . Gomis celebrates his second goal of the afternoon to push Hull close towards the relegation zone . ‘The situation is worrying. It’s always worrying when you are down there because there are always twists and turns in the last few weeks. ‘This has got to be a massive wake-up call because it’s all right when you are a few places above the relegation zone but you look at the points difference and it’s nothing really, a weekend can change it. ‘We are definitely bang in it. It’s always the same, every year there are teams that put runs together and others who get dragged into it. Gomis unleashed a thunderous overhead kick before half-time to capitalise on some poor Hull defending . David Meyler's red card left Hull in a difficult position, when they were threatening to get back into it . ‘We have to realise that we are fighting for every point. We need to sort it out.’ Ki Sung-Yueng put Swansea ahead and Bafetimbi Gomis scored a brilliant bicycle kick for 2-0. McShane got Hull back in the game before David Meyler was sent off and Gomis finished the job in stoppage time. The Frenchman has now scored eight times this season but it remains to be seen if he stays beyond the summer following his agitations for a move in January.

              " {'sequence': \"Blackburn Rovers manager Gary Bowyer has hit out at FA Cup rules which prevent him from fielding one of his own players against Liverpool in Wednesday night's sixth round replay at Ewood Park because he was on loan when the first tie was played on March 9. Bowyer, who has a lengthy injury list at his Championship club, wanted to include 21-year-old midfielder John O'Sullivan to face The Reds having recalled him from a loan spell with League One Barnsley last month. However, there was no dispensation because O'Sullivan was at Oakwell when the initial 0-0 draw between the teams was played at Anfield. Blackburn midfielder John O'Sullivan (right) is ineligible to play in their FA Cup fifth round replay vs Liverpool . Gary Bowyer says it 'doesn't make sense' that he can't use O'Sullivan, who's been recalled from Barnsley . Bowyer said: 'It will be a huge achievement to beat Liverpool in these circumstances. Because of the embargo (for breaching FPP rules) we are only allowed a squad of 24 players and have played 13 games in 43 days. 'So to be told we can't even play one of our own players because he was sent on on loan before the first game doesn't make sense to me. He's only been a Blackburn player for six years! 'We sent John away to help his development. He's back now, he'd be eligible for the semi-final if we get there, but not the quarter-final replay.' Ewood Park will have a capacity crowd for the first time since they were relegated from the Premier League in 2012 and Bowyer hopes the fans take a lead from Crystal Palace supporters. O'Sullivan (left), who was on loan at Barnsley, will be available to play if Blackburn reach the semi-finals though . 'The Palace fans got them over the line against Manchester City on Monday night and we need our supporters to be the 12th man, 13th man or even 14th man. 'There were six thousand of our supporters at Anfield and they never shut up. The players talked about it afterwards and we need them again. There is a buzz around the place.' Liverpool have had a torrid fortnight and arrive in Lancashire without suspended players Emre Can, Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel. In addition, a contract issue with Raheem Sterling has been a distraction while the club have lost their last two league games against Manchester United and Arsenal. 'It's still ridiculous to talk about them as a club in crisis. We are massive underdogs,' added Bowyer, who is without 14 senior professionals including Josh King, Chris Taylor, Grant Hanley and possibly Craig Conway on Wednesday.

              " {'sequence': \"The importance of Saturday's match against Arsenal for Liverpool’s Champion’s League ambitions cannot be overstated. The reverse fixture, a 2-2 draw in December, prompted Liverpool’s renaissance into the Premier League’s form team. Thereafter, they went 13 top-flight games without defeat and put themselves in contention to qualify for Europe’s top competition before losing to Manchester United in a drama-filled match two weeks ago. Juan Mata's acrobatic volley two weeks ago left Liverpool five points adrift of Manchester United in fourth . Brendan Rodgers' side need to beat Arsenal on Saturday to keep up their chances of a top-four finish . Liverpool have been in good form since they last played Arsenal, but are not in the Champions League spots . A defeat could leave Liverpool eight points adrift of the top four with just seven games to play, a massive mountain to climb. The statistics suggest victory at the Emirates is an unlikely scenario. In six games against the Premier League’s other top-five sides, Liverpool have won just one and picked up four points compared with Manchester United who have won three of five games against their toughest competition. In Arsenal they face a side who have cemented their Champions League spot with four top-flight wins in as many games in March. For their efforts, Arsene Wenger was given the Manager of the Month award for a 14th time and striker Olivier Giroud the Player of the Month trophy. Liverpool are likely to face a side riding on a wave of confidence and optimism so it will be a tough ask to get a result. With more money on offer than ever before, Liverpool know they need to be at Europe's top table . Raheem Sterling and Phlippe Coutinho train ahead of the vital trip to Arsenal on Saturday . It is not just the pride of fans at stake in this game but also the financial security of the club. A Sportsmail study this week revealed the race for Champion’s League has gained even more importance after UEFA announced significant increases in prize money for their top competition from next season. Cash for appearing in the group stages onwards is increasing by up to 50 per cent, and for English clubs there will also be steep hikes in 'market pool' money from UEFA's TV incomes. If an English club were to win next season's Champions League, they would earn around £75m at today's exchange rates from central UEFA funds alone. Ticket income plus any commercial bonuses\\xa0would be on top. Under current prize money arrangements, clubs reaching the group stage receive £6.4m each plus £750,000 per group win and £370,000 per draw. The basic fee will rise 40 per cent to  £8.9m and each win will jump 50 per cent to £1.1m. Prize money for reaching the last 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals will leap up 57 per cent, respectively to £4m, £4.44m and £5.2m. The prize for being tournament runner-up will jump from £4.8m to £7.8m while the winner's prize will jump from £7.8m to £11.11m. For a team like Liverpool, who enjoy a big worldwide profile, particularly in Asia, money like that could solidify their position among the European elite for the next decade. Securing European football will also be vital to ensure they attract world-class players and keep the ones they already have at the club. Even with Champions League qualification Liverpool were unable to hold on to Luis Suarez last summer . Sterling's contract situation demonstrates how important it is for Rodgers' side to qualify . The contract wrangling with Raheem Sterling in recent weeks will undoubtedly have been a distraction to the player himself and the focus of manager Brendan Rodgers but they will have to put that to one side if they are to overcome Arsenal. On the Sterling subject, it would be much easier to resolve his future and persuade him to remain in Merseyside come the end of the season if Liverpool have the certainty of Champions League football to offer as an enticement. Players want to compete on the biggest stage they can. Regardless of how much money each week is being offered, the chance to play against the best teams in Europe is priceless.\",\n",

Negri joined the Ibrox outfit from Italian side Perugia for £3.5million in 1997, scoring a staggering 23 goals in his first 10 league games for the club. However, a series of injuries destabilised his career in Glasgow including a reserve match against Aberdeen on November 13, 2000. Ex-Rangers forward Marco Negri has revealed that he quit the club after fearing he had AIDS . Cosenza (Italy) - 19 goals in 34 league games - (1994-95) Perugia (Italy) - 33 in 60 - (1995-97) Rangers - 32 in 30 - (1997-2001) Vicenza (Italy, on loan) - 1 in 9 - (1999-00) Bologna (Italy) - 0 in 3 - (2001-02) Cagliari (Italy) - 2 in 5 - (2002) Livorno (Italy) 8 in 10 - (2002-03) Perugia - 0 in 3 - (2004-05) During the encounter the then 30-year-old forward was on the receiving end of a crunching tackle that caused his right shinbone to bleed profusely. After hospital tests and treatment for what was perceived as a 'deep wound', Negri returned to action in the New Year to train with the reserve team where he suffered a shooting pain in his right knee and leg. Further scans at Ross Hall Hospital showed an inflammation of the shinbone and more worryingly that properties of his blood had been attacked by a lymphogranuloma or lymphosarcoma - common symptoms for those that suffer with HIV/AIDS. However, in his imminent autobiography 'Moody Blue - The Story of the Mysterious Marco', which is serialised in the Daily Record; the now 44-year-old reveals that his worst fears weren't confirmed after flying to Italy for treatment. 'I was immediately hospitalised. I hadn’t even considered the possibility of being HIV positive but the harsh reality was there in front of me in the medical report, and it was hard to ignore and digest,' Negri wrote. In his  autobiography, Negri (left) reveals his nightmare started after a reserve match vs Aberdeen in 2000 . After months of hospital scans in Scotland, Negri (right) was told in Italy that his blood was absolutely fine . 'I didn’t feel able to deal with such a thing alone. I needed my family around me and wanted to undergo further tests in Italy to understand exactly what was going on, the risks and chances of recovery. 'I had to return to Italy, and not on a temporary basis. I asked my lawyer to speak to Rangers about an early dissolution of my contract. 'They had no objections to the premature ending of our relationship, which was something I really appreciated, although it also showed me how serious my condition was. 'Luckily, I didn’t have to wait long to learn I was simply suffering a stress fracture of the tibial axis of the knee. This diagnosis was given by doctors in Bologna. In Scotland they hadn’t got it right this time, even if the results of three blood tests confirmed some anomalies that couldn’t be overlooked. 'Further tests found my blood to be absolutely fine and there was no need for medication or invasive treatment. My drama had been resolved in the best way possible, and I put behind me the endless days of terror when the worst case scenario was swimming around in my head.'

The arresting officers in the cases, which include burglary, cocaine possession and aggravated assault with a firearm, are no longer on the police force. Scroll down for video . Criminal cases connected to four former Fort Lauderdale police officers have been dismissed after an investigation into a racist video and messages sent by the four cops.\\xa0Above, Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Frank Adderley (far right) speaks about three of the officers' firings at a press conference in March . All of the four officers committed misconduct involving racist texts 'exchanged among themselves and former police officers', Chf Adderley said. Above, in this text, Christopher Sousa refers to killing n******' In another text message, Holding writes: 'Id have that noose ready' - in reference to black men. Jason Holding, James Wells and Christopher Sousa, all of Fort Lauderdale. were fired in March for 'department misconduct'. Alex Alvarez resigned in January . Officials say 22-year-old Alex Alvarez resigned, while 30-year-old James Wells, 31-year-old Jason Holding and 25-year-old Christopher Sousa were fired after a five-month investigation, according to The South Florida Sun Sentinel. The investigation began after a woman - Alvarez's former fiancee - filed a complaint in October. The series of text messages were filled with the N-word and other slurs, and the video included a doctored image of President Barack Obama wearing gold teeth, images of a Ku Klux Klan hood and a police dog attacking a black man. In their cellphone messages, the officers sent each other 'racial, sexist and ethically inappropriate' images and other content, including offensive comments against both Hispanics and homosexuals. They also 'criticized their coworkers' grammar, appearance, work ethic and referred to an entire shift as lazy (expletives)'. And they even talked about killing and injuring black people, CBS reported. In one text, Sousa reportedly wrote: 'Holdings we are coming and drinking all your beer and killing n******.' In another, Holding said: 'Id have that noose ready (sic)', according to the Sun Sentinel. Officer Alex Alvarez, 22, who apparently created the video (pictured: a still), resigned from the city's force in late January - before the investigation into he and his colleagues' exchanges was complete . The video for the fictitious 'The Hoods' film, which apparently used the N-word repeatedly, featured pictures of a wanted poster for 'an escaped slave' and black men looking down the barrel of a gun (pictured) The video also included photos of black men being bitten by a dog (pictured), a police investigation determined . The disturbing footage, which apparently used the N-word repeatedly, also featured pictures of a wanted poster for 'an escaped slave' and a caricature of President Obama with gold-capped teeth. All of the four officers involved in the case committed misconduct involving racist texts 'exchanged among themselves and former police officers', Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Frank Adderley said . Chief Adderley, who is African-American, added that the officers did not engage in criminal behavior, 'but their conduct was inexcusable and there is zero tolerance for this kind of behavior' in the force. A spokesman for the state attorney's office says all of the dropped cases involve black defendants. Sherman Bynes is one of the defendants whose criminal case has been dismissed. He was arrested by Holding in March 2014 . 'This is a serious matter. We continue to review each case in which these former policemen were the principal officers involved in the arrest,' spokesman Ron Ishoy told the Sun Sentinel. 'We are dropping charges against the defendants where it is appropriate.' One of the first felony cases dropped was Holding's arrest of Sherman Bynes, 36, in March 2014. Gordan Weekes, a chief assistant in the city's public defender's office called the arrest 'a classic case of driving while black'. Bynes was pulled over by Holding after rolling through a stop sign in a new Kia owned by the rental car company he worked for. Holding called for a police dog to search the car and Bynes's person and found a baggie of marijuana in Bynes' pocket and 14 grams of marijuana, a digital scale and several small plastic bags in a backpack in the trunk. He also said that Bynes was not wearing his seat belt. Holding arrested Bynes, who was charged with possession with intent to sell cannabis and traffic violations. Bynes said Holding was 'extremely aggressive toward him in his demeanor,' but used no racially offensive language during the stop, according to Bynes's lawyer. 'Holding's bias was insurmountable as he was clearly engaging in racially predatory policing that was consistent with his offensive text conversations,' Weekes said. Broward Public Defender Howard Finkelstein said that between January 1, 2014, and the time the officers left the force, they were involved in 56 felony arrests of black and other minority suspects. Chief Adderley (pictured) revealed the four officers had told him they had been just joking around. 'Based on the investigation, they felt, in their words, that it was a joke,' he said at a news conference in March . The three fired officers are disputing their termination from the force and are trying to get their jobs back. They have arbitration hearings on April 15. Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler said in March that he was 'very disappointed, disgusted and shocked' by the inquiry's findings, describing the officers as 'a few bad apples' in a 'diverse' police department. He added city and department leadership had agreed that the multiple sackings were appropriate. Meanwhile, City Manager Lee Feldman said: 'It's extremely unfortunate that these acts of racism and hatred took place'. He also expressed his thanks toward Alvarez's fiancée for coming forward. The police department in south-east Florida, which has around 500 agents, has now created a human diversity class that all officers must attend on an annual basis in the wake of the incident. The Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #31 represents the officers. FOP President Jack Lokeinsky said everyone is entitled to due process, and the officers have the right to a fair review of the facts.

Patrick O'Flynn, who is also the party's economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to 'work harder' as it is 'lagging' behind with female voters. As he launched the party's 'policies for women' alongside the Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans and MEP Diane James, Mr O'Flynn was forced to defend its 'blokeish' image under Nigel Farage. Patrick O'Flynn, who is also the party's economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to 'work harder' as it is 'lagging' behind with female voters . Polls suggest around 15 per cent of men are planning to back Ukip, compared to only 10 per cent of women. Mr O'Flynn: 'Nigel has said sometimes Ukip has resembled a rugby club on tour. I think that's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that. 'But we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party, men in the party, who should know better, have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism. When that happens I make sure I express my own displeasure. 'We're a very fast-growing party, we're increasing our attraction – it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we're not maximising our support in every potential group. 'And, as set out today, there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters – we still are, we've got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing.'

Ukip leader Nigel Farage is often photographed smoking cigarettes and drinking pints of beer . The party used the event confirm a raft of policies, including removing VAT from sanitary products, which they have dubbed a 'tampon tax'. It also said it would give 'absolute, full and unconditional' support for current maternity and paternity leave laws, as well as making sure maternity wards are 'properly resourced'. Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is 'accepted cultural practice' for some of 'our ethnic compatriots'. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party's election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on 'lies' and 'myths' spread about the party. She said: 'I think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us.

'Unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep.' Suzanne\\xa0Evans, who is writing the party's election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on 'lies' and 'myths' spread about the party . Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom was forced out of the party in September 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as 'sluts'.

Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson and Jambos defender Alim Ozturk have both rounded on their city rivals for refusing a public display of acknowledgement for the Championship title winners at Easter Road. Rangers lined up to applaud Hearts on to the Ibrox pitch when the teams played just over a week ago, and Queen of the South and Alloa did the same. But Stubbs, who admitted that the police hadn't been consulted, insisted that the threat of unrest – not a lack of respect – was responsible for the decision. Hibs boss Alan Stubbs feared unrest among fans if his side formed a guard of honour for city rivals Hearts . 'It's been turned into a lack of respect,' said the Hibs boss. 'Well, I rang Robbie the day after they won the league and congratulated them and said they had been the best team over the season and that it had been fully deserved. 'My players have come out in the press and said Hearts have been the best team. I think that's respect. 'The reason why we decided against it is because there are two sets of rivals fans, it's a derby, there's going to be a lot of animosity. You are going to have one set of fans that will be jovial because they've won the league, you'll have one that are not going to be happy about that. 'The most important thing is the safety of the fans and that's the main reason we've done it. We don't want to start the game on a bad foot, that's the reason we've done it. Not a lack of respect. It's a respect for fans. It's a decision we spoke about and we feel as if it's the right decision for both sets of fans. 'We can't let this get out of control for the reasons we've done it. We've seen silly things happen over the years and we don't want to get into that state because of a guard of honour. 'If I won the league and we were at Tynecastle, I wouldn't expect a guard of honour there. We don't turn around and say because one team has done it every other team has to. I wouldn't expect it. 'Because you know it only takes on person. Before you know it, you've got a situation on your hands that could have been prevented. We want the derby to be spoken about for the right reasons, not the wrong reasons – and it only takes one idiot.' Agreeing that it would be unthinkable for either Old Firm team to offer their oldest rivals a guard of honour in a similar situation, Stubbs said: 'So why's it any different here? 'It's a derby and it means a lot to both sets of fans.' Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson feels that it is disrespectful not to acknowledge his team's achievements . Hearts fans favourite Ozturk inferred that the decision not to have a guard of honour showed a lack of respect by Hibs, while boss Neilson claimed it could backfire on them on the pitch. 'It is up to them if they want to do it,' said Ozturk. 'But other teams have shown respect to us - and if Hibs don't want to do it, that says a lot about them. 'Teams like Rangers showed us a little bit of respect for a fantastic season and it's a good feeling because you have worked really hard all season to win the league like this. 'That kind of respect you get is really nice but they [Hibs] are not going to do it, so that is it. Is that going to motivate me? Yes. I have a lot of respect for the other teams. This gives us extra motivation to show them why we' re champions. If you're asking me, I would have no problem with doing that for Hibs.' Neilson added: 'That's Hibs' prerogative. I think it will actually take some of the focus off our players, instead of coming out to a guard of honour and not concentrating on the game. 'It can also give the opposition team a bit of spirit and a bit of fight to say: 'We've given you a guard of honour, now we are going to turn you over!' That can happen. 'I've been in that situation where you are standing there clapping, and your first thought is to go out there and show them. Hopefully it will work in our favour that they don't do it on Sunday.'

But when it came to a crossbar challenge against some of Spurs finest he was left in the unfamiliar position. At the conclusion of an open training session for fans at White Hart Lane on Thursday morning Kane lined up against Etienne Capoue, Nabil Bentaleb, Eric Dier, Roberto Soldado, Danny Rose and the apparent king of the crossbar, Christian Eriksen. Harry Kane awaits his chance to impress in a crossbar challenge during open training at White Hart Lane . The adage 'Close but no cigar' best represents the opening round of attempts from 40 yards. Capoue, Bentaleb, Soldado, Dier, Kane and Eriksen, ignoring attempts from his team-mates to distact him, all went narrowly over the top, while Rose dared to be different by hitting the back of the net. Capoue did the same again but Algerian Bentaleb gave the crowd of mostly children enjoying their half term break something to cheer about as his floating shot landed on the crossbar. Christian Eriksen takes his attempt in spite of his team-mates efforts to distract the skillful Swede . Kane take his time with each of his three shots from 40 yards but is narrowly over the crossbar each time . It was the same story as round one for the rest before a third go was approved by the fans - Capoue took his chance as his shot dipped at the end. Kane's third go was no good but a fourth out of shot hit the mark and won a big cheer, though couldn't count. The game ended a sucessful day for the club whose form has been mixed of late with a disappointing 0-0 draw with Burnley on Sunday a major disappointment. Etienne Capoue is  on the money with his third attempt at the crossbar challenge and celebrates accordingly . Spurs' UEFA Cup-winning captain Graham Roberts was on hand to provide inspiration though, as were Spurs Ladies represetnatives Wendy Martin and captain Jenna Schillaci, who were interviewed ahead of their Ryman Cup final against Charlton on April 16.

That hasn’t always been the case during the Spaniard’s debut season at Old Trafford. Between October 20 and February 17, Herrera was barely sighted and started just three of the 21 games Manchester United played in that period, prompting much chatter about his place in the squad. It is no secret David Moyes wanted to bring Herrera to Old Trafford on deadline day in August 2013 but red tape scuppered his ambitions; United pressed ahead with transfer after Moyes was jettisoned but his inactivity prompted questions: Did Louis van Gaal want him or rate him? Ander Herrera, pictured with Juan Mata, netted a brace to ensure his side claimed the win against Aston Villa . Herrera has established himself in Louis van Gaal's first team plans after missing out in previous months . Antonio Valencia (right) congratulates two-goal hero Herrera (centre) after the final whistle . The settling in process was not easy but the 25-year-old’s head has never dropped and in the interview with the club publication, Herrera made it clear that a lack of action was never going to leave him at loggerheads with Van Gaal. ‘I am very happy, he said. ‘Even when I wasn’t playing, I was also happy. I am at Manchester United. I feel really lucky to be here. We have to respect his decision. He wants the best for us, the team and we have to follow him always.’ Herrera’s commitment was amply rewarded against Aston Villa. The brightest spark in a Red jersey, he was certainly in the right place at the right time in the 43rd minute, when sweeping a terrific effort past Brad Guzan to set United on their way. His passing was slick, his movement was clever and it was appropriate he bookended this victory with United’s third in injury time; it was fifth shot on target in the Barclays Premier League and, amazingly, his fifth goal. No wonder he left with acclaim from his manager ringing in his ears. ‘I knew Ander has a touch of class,’ said Van Gaal. ‘Sometimes he was not composed at the right moment but now he has composure. Scoring seven goals in a season when he hasn’t played so much? I think that’s fantastic.’\",\n",

Tiger Woods achieved it at the Home of Golf. When it comes to the career Grand Slam the stars align it seems, and it is completed with wondrous deeds on fitting stages. And now Rory McIlroy has the chance to join the exalted company of just five men at Augusta National, of all places. As Woods put it: 'Where better could you ask for than to complete it here?' Rory McIlroy tees off on the first during his practice round ahead of the 2015 Masters on Thursday . McIlroy is targeting his third major title and the completion of his career Grand Slam at Augusta . McIlroy (left) chats with Tiger Woods, who is ranked 111th in the world at present, at the course on Wednesday . And so, 155 years after the first major championship, another season opens with a potentially epochal event. A campaign that will take us to uncharted territory near Seattle for the United States Open and St Andrews for The Open; to the whispering wilds of Wisconsin for the PGA. But it is here, where more majors have been held than any other venue, where we begin with the most exciting storylines of all. This 79th Masters was set up beautifully as it was, with McIlroy's bid to win a third straight major, but Tiger's return has elevated it to another plane. Love him or not, there's no denying the frisson of added excitement he brings. Noticeably thinner and brimming with health, how good to see him walking around with a smile on his face as well and signing autographs, clearly thrilled to be showing his kids the place where he has left an indelible mark. Is this Scrooge-like conversion a sign he doesn't think he can win any more, or is he just a man whose heart has grown fonder through absence? Whatever the answer, it will make for compelling viewing over the next few days as the man who won 11 of his 14 majors ranked No 1 in the world tries to win one ranked 111th. And here's a nice little omen to send him on his way: Darren Clarke was ranked 111th when he won The Open Championship at Royal St George's in 2011. World No 1 McIlroy signs autographs for a host of young fans following his practice round on Wednesday . In the press room on Tuesday it was as if Rory and Tiger had switched personalities, with the former the subdued, somewhat reluctant one. To be fair to McIlroy, he's been answering the same questions for eight long months. He's talked out about the Grand Slam. Now he gets the chance to enter the blessed sanctuary that inside the ropes provides and finally seize his opportunity to set a new benchmark for European golf rather than talk about it. For two of his four major championship victories, McIlroy got a huge helping hand from Mother Nature, as great dollops of rain rendered Congressional for the 2011 US Open and Valhalla for last year's USPGA soft and defenceless — the sort of dart-throwing contest which is right up McIlroy's alley. This Masters might get interrupted as well by an afternoon thunderstorm or two but it is also expected to get under way on Thursday with near record temperatures for this time of year. Add that to Augusta National's sub-air system under the greens and there will be no darts thrown here. As it should be. If you're going to join legends, you should be doing it the hard way. A flock of fans capture a Woods shot on their smartphones as the American star went through his paces . McIlroy might be the bookies' favourite for good reason but his Augusta record offers up a litany of damning statistics he must rectify before he can be considered for a green jacket. Can you believe that as good a driver as the Northern Irishman is, he has hit the par five 13th fairway just four times in 22 attempts in competition? Or that he has had no birdies in 44 tries on the holes that start the front and back nines. This week we will truly get the chance to gauge his development as a golfer. Alongside him for the first two days will be Phil Mickelson, another player who had all the attributes to win Augusta at 25 but had to wait until the age of 33 to win his first Masters. It might be that McIlroy has to wait a while longer, too. There are not only questions about his own record at Augusta that the world No 1 must answer. There's the formidable form of his peers. The next six players in the rankings — Henrik Stenson, Bubba Watson, Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Adam Scott and Dustin Johnson — have all either won a tournament in the past two months or have a green jacket already. It is inconceivable at least one won't hit form. Phil Mickelson will play alongside McIlroy for the first two days of the tournament in Augusta . The list of potential winners stretches longer. Indeed, there's not a great golf-playing territory in the world that won't be watching with legitimate hopes of seeing one of its own triumph. Nowhere will that anticipation be greater than here. A win for McIlroy and papers will be filled with where it ranks in the annals of the great feats achieved by UK sportsmen. There's no point discussing what might be the ending when the drama has not even begun. But it's perfectly acceptable to keep fingers crossed and dare to wonder whether, over the next four days, we're going to be witnesses to a singular piece of UK sporting history.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"It is just 12 weeks since bold claims were emanating from an ultra-confident Dundee United dressing room that this season could yield an unprecedented domestic Treble. ‘I believe we can win all three trophies,’ trumpeted goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak. ‘People might laugh at me but maybe in May we will have won the league and cups and I will be laughing.’ On Wednesday night against Dundee at Dens Park, however, those carefree early January days seemed so long ago as Cierzniak’s grip of the ball for Greg Stewart’s opening goal proved as tight as his grasp on footballing reality. Dundee United manager\\xa0Jackie McNamara is under pressure following his side's recent slump . Dundee United failed to get their hands on the Scottish League Cup  as they fell to a 2-0 defeat by Celtic . Scottish Premiership outfit Dundee United have failed to win any of their last 10 games . As United slumped to a first derby defeat in 11 years, the loss at Dens Park saw Jackie McNamara’s team make it 10 matches without a win. It’s not yet May but nobody is laughing at Tannadice as the club gets to grips with an implosion of cataclysmic proportions both on and off the park. It does seem a touch bizarre that all is not well at a club that has reached back-to-back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years; qualified for European competition in three of the last four years; finished in the Premiership top six in every one of the last seven years and won the Scottish Cup in 2010. Yet as United have dropped like a stone from early-season table-toppers to potentially even missing out on Europe, the fallout has come amid an increasingly acrid war of words surrounding revelations about McNamara’s entitlement to a cut from outgoing player sales. Those close to Tannadice speak of a series of damaging schisms developing on all sides between fans, board and manager; cumulatively casting increased uncertainty over McNamara’s future. Ahead of the annual general meeting of influential supporters’ group ArabTRUST, one leading fan told Sportsmail of ‘overwhelming unhappiness’ with McNamara’s bonus, while his recruitment and tactical nous are also being questioned. There is, he added, a growing belief among fans that the manager’s position is ‘untenable’. But this has been a slow-burning civil war. The seeds of the crisis that appear to have taken place at almost every level of the club were first sown at the end of the winter transfer window when chairman Stephen Thompson took the unpopular decision to sell star players Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to Celtic. As furious fans pointed out, hadn’t Thomson used the eve of last May’s Scottish Cup Final defeat by St Johnstone to declare Tannadice finances to be their finest since 1986 and vow there would be no player exodus, as occurred after the Scottish Cup win in 2010 under Peter Houston? Dundee United sold Stuart Armstrong (left) to Celtic during the January transfer window . Gary Mackay-Steven also sealed a winter move to Celtic on transfer deadline day . The Tannadice supremo even went as far as name-checking Armstrong along with Ryan Gauld and Andrew Robertson as players he would like to keep for ‘at least another year’ to help ‘compete’ with Celtic. Gauld and Robertson were quickly sold for £3million each last summer, although the fees for both made the sales palatable. Yet parting with Armstrong and Mackay-Steven just 48 hours after reaching a League Cup Final against a Celtic side Thompson had vowed to ‘compete’ with proved particularly painful for the rank and file. ‘I thought it was a strange decision, I must admit,’ said former United defender and BBC analyst Mark Wilson recently. ‘I can understand letting Mackay-Steven go because he had signed a pre-contract with Celtic but Armstrong is a different case. ‘United were in touching distance of Celtic and if you are serious about challenging, then you can sell him in June. ‘I read McNamara saying he wanted to keep both players but that they needed to balance the books. But they sold Gauld and Robertson for substantial fees in the summer and I read the chairman talking about how great the club’s finances are. ‘It was just a bit odd. Especially selling to Celtic, a rival, rather than an English team.’ At first, United closed ranks to slap down their detractors, reacting with an almost weary derision to anyone questioning the wisdom of selling key players at such a crucial part of the season. Dundee United striker Ryan Dow has scored just two league goals during the course of the current season . Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper Scott Bain . After starting life post-Armstrong and Mackay-Steven with a comprehensive 3-0 Scottish Cup victory at Stranraer, the line spun was that the two players, while talented, did not constitute a two-man team. They were at pains to point out that as United stormed to the top of the Premiership at the start of the season, Armstrong was often injured while an off-form Mackay-Steven was regularly left on the bench. Indeed, it was argued that, together, the duo started just three of United’s first nine games of the campaign, of which McNamara’s side won seven, drew one and lost one. After that Stair Park victory, two-goal Ryan Dow was hailed as the man to step into Armstrong and Mackay-Steven’s goalscoring boots. Dow has not hit the net since. Worryingly, United then slumped to their first back-to-back defeats of the season and went on to lose the League Cup Final to Celtic. Bain refuses to react as the Turkish striker does his best to rile his rival goalkeeper at Den Park . Turkish forward Ciftci celebrates with a kiss but ends up blushing as his side lose derby match . Jake McPake wheels away in celebration as helps Dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . Over the course of four March meetings with Ronny Deila’s men, United were dispatched from the Scottish Cup and defeated in the league, too, as McNamara’s season started to disintegrate. As the heat rose on Thompson, the United chairman first admitted the sales were a wrong footballing decision but correct from a financial standpoint. Curiously, though, the spotlight would then eventually turn on McNamara as ArabTRUST and the Federation of Dundee United Supporters’ Clubs released a statement saying they were shocked 25 per cent of £6.3m worth of transfer fees for Gauld, Robertson, Armstrong and Mackay-Steven were paid in commission to unnamed parties. United continue to deny the figures in question but eventually made the bombshell confirmation that McNamara was indeed entitled to a cut of player transfers. Even if it was done with the best of intentions — to reduce the manager’s salary in straitened times while bumping his earnings up if successful in developing young talent to sell — the revelation was toxic in the eyes of many fans. Their new-found ire towards a manager who led them to two consecutive finals has been further roused by United losing five-in-a-row for the first time since May 2006. Amid this poor run, St Johnstone defender Frazer Wright recently claimed that if McNamara’s men fall behind, ‘it gets in their heads’ and they ‘argue amongst themselves’. Dundee Utd goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak looks back at his goal after Mark Stewart opened the scoring . Stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at Den Park . Defeat at Tannadice against hapless Hamilton — without a win in 12 games — is now rendered unthinkable, even if victory would clinch a top-six finish for city rivals Dundee. There are those within Dens Park who sense a real opportunity to become the first Dark Blues side to finish above United in the league since 2002-03. A loss, coupled with a win for on-form Dundee at St Johnstone, would see Paul Hartley’s men go above United in the table on Saturday. Few could have guessed that scenario when, in the first hours of 2015, United took Dundee apart in a record 6-2 derby win at Tannadice. Not least Paul Heffernan, who, as a Hibs player, was impressed by United in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Easter Road in the League Cup in October before McNamara’s side sneaked through on penalties. ‘I’m sure the fans would love us to finish above United — and it’s all to play for,’ said the Irish striker, who scored the third in Dundee’s 3-1 win at Dens on Wednesday night. ‘We’re only two points behind United now, so we’ve just got to keep going when the split comes. Dundee United's Chris Erskine goes down under a challenge from Stephen McGinn during the Dundee derby . Dundee's Paul Heffernan taps home his side's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . ‘I’m surprised that they have gone 10 games without a win. When I was still at Hibs earlier this season, we played them in the League Cup and they were a very good side. ‘It’s a long time not to win but they’ve still got very good players in the team. I’m sure they will come good again. ‘I’d actually like it if they came good against Hamilton on Saturday, though. That would be perfect because it would cement our place in the top-six. ‘So here’s hoping they can turn it around on Saturday because it would help us. It would be ironic, I know, if United clinched us a top-six place. ‘But we go to St Johnstone knowing we are definitely in the top six if we win there.’ While the tangerine half of Dundee mourns its fall from grace, the Dark Blues are in raptures after breaking a sequence of derbies without victory stretching back to November 2004. ‘Ending that run against United was a big motivating factor — and I felt that was the best I’ve seen us play,’ said Heffernan. ‘A lot of the players haven’t been here that long. But, for the sake of the fans who haven’t witnessed a win over United for such a long time, it was really important. We did it for them. I’m sure they will enjoy this one for a long time to come.’ After a long era in the shadow of their neighbours, Dundee are daring to dream. Amid a tangerine nightmare, however, for a United side in crisis, the Treble that once lay ahead has been replaced by trouble.\",\n",

Hassan Anywabwile (left) from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Abdul Arwani (right) at the An-Noor Mosque in Acton. Mr Arwani was found dead on Wednesday with bullet wounds in his chest . Mr Arwani stepped down from his role at the mosque last year after it was repeatedly linked to extremism. When contacted, staff at the An-Noor Mosque refused to answer questions about the former preacher's time there . Over the course of six days, almost 100 members of the Islamic organisation were involved in holding hostages at gunpoint in the island's capital, Port of Spain. The city's police headquarters were blown up in the coup, with Mr Anyabwile described by a Parliamentary report of being 'responsible for organising the use' of the explosives involved. The coup ended after six days with the insurgents' surrendering on the condition of amnesty on August 1. Twenty-four people had been killed in the anarchy. It is understood Mr Anyabwile replaced Mr Arwani at the An-Noor mosque in Acton, West London, some time around 2013.\\xa0He is registered as having lived in London since 2005. Mr Arwani stepped down from the An-Noor mosque last year following repeated accusations that it was linked to extremism. When approached this afternoon Mr Anyabwile, who became partially disabled after being shot four times in legs, denied any knowledge of any dispute. Anyabwile is named in a Trinidadian parliamentary report on an attempted coup which saw 24 people killed in 1990. He is described as being 'responsible' for the use of explosives in the blowing of police headquarters . Mr Anyabwile did not comment on claims Mr Arwani had been embroiled in a dispute with the mosque when approached . Arriving for midday prayers the man, who was helped into a wheelchair by a security guard, told the MailOnline: 'Feud? I know nothing about that. 'All I can say is from Allah we come, and to Allah we return.' When contacted today another member of staff at the mosque refused to answer questions about Mr Arwani's time there. A statement printed on a piece of paper and taped to its front door read: 'We have with great sadness heard of the unfortunate death of Shaykh [sic] Abdulhadi Arwarni who was the former Imam of the Annoor [sic] Cultural & Community Centre who served from 2005 to 2011, he will be sadly missed. 'We send our sympathies and condolences to his family, the Muslim community and friends. May Allah forgive him and open the doors of mercy onto him.' But one friend of the late imam said the dispute between the father of six and the An-Noor Mosque had been heated. Solicitor\\xa0Mohammad Bassam Tablieh, 43, said there had been conflict about the 'running' of the mosque. There is no suggestion that either Mr Anyabwile or the An-Noor mosque in Acton is suspected of  any involvement in his death, with counter terrorism police still investigating. Scotland Yard officers called in the specialist division because 'of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. 'The investigation remains in its very early stages and officers remain open-minded about the motive,' a spokesman added. Earlier this week sources close to the Mr Arwani said they feared he may have been killed by supporters of the Syrian president Bashar-al-Assad - of whom the imam was a fierce critic. Describing his father as 'the most peaceful man you could meet,' one of his six children, Murhaf, said he was 'actively involved in the fight against extremism'. 'He did not care what your background, race or status was. He did not care if you were rich or poor. 'He just wanted to help people in need. He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it,' he said in a statement. Later his 23-year-old daughter, Elham Arwani, said while her father was openly 'against Assad', she did not think that was the reason behind his killing. Mr Arwani's family said they did not believe his death was connected to his opposition of the Assad regime. Speaking at the family home (above), his 23-year-old daughter said that was likely 'not the reason' Anyabwile was involved in the attempted coup of Trinidad and Tobago in 1990. Above, a rebel fighter stands with his AK-47 during the six-day standoff . Almost 25 years ago, around 100 members of the radical Islamic group Jamaat-al-Muslimeen stormed Trinidad and Tobago's Parliament in Port of Spain. They were demanding that the then Prime Minister, Arthur Robinson, resign and that new elections be held, accusing the leader of wild extravagance while, they said, its working classes went hungry. The rebels blew up Port of Spain's police headquarters and stormed a state-run television channel in a bid to take control of the Trinidadian capital. The Muslimeen's leader, Yasin Abu Bakr, appeared ominously on air during the first day of the coup attempt. Among one of their hostages was Mr Robinson. The Prime Minister was shot and beaten during the six-day coup. Violence and looting ravaged the city as all those who had been in the buildings when the Muslimeen stormed remained in their capture. On its sixth day, the rebels agreed to surrender on the condition of amnesty - releasing what remaining hostages they were keeping unharmed. They were all arrested and charged with treason but later released after producing copies of an amnesty that had been agreed when brokering an end to the coup. Anyabwile, formerly known in the Caribbean as\\xa0Beville Marshall, is thought to have separated from the Muslimeen in 2001. Years later he was shot four times in the legs, leaving him in need of a wheelchair. He had tried to establish his own Islamist group, according to the Trinidadian press. In 2004 a local report claimed he had been turned down for asylum by the Home Office having told them that his life would be in danger if he returned to the Caribbean island. The attempted coup brought the island's capital to a standstill with looting and violence rife for days . But friends and neighbours claimed critics of the Assad regime had been targeted in the area, with some residents who displayed green flags, a sign of opposition to the Syrian government, having their tyres slashed. Mr Arwani grew up in Hama, the site of a notorious 1982 massacre where up to 40,000 civilians were killed by the Syrian Army under the orders of Hafez al-Assad, the current president's father. He fled the country as a 16-year-old, taking refuge in the UK while his parents faced routine questioning of his whereabouts for years. One of the mourners who gathered in his memory at Nadi Park Royal in Willesden Junction, north west London,\\xa0said he had returned to Syria in recent years to dissuade fighters from aligning themselves with the Government. The source claimed Mr Arwani stopped going to the country on advice from the Turkish authorities. The An-Noor Mosque, where Mr Arwani used to be one of the main imams, has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers. It became notorious in 2013 when a terror suspect went there and changed into a burqa in order to escape surveillance then went on the run. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed has been missing for 16 months, and was last seen entering An-Noor dressed as a man before leaving in a full-length covering designed for women which obscured his identity. He was subject to a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure, which restrict the movements of people suspected of involvement in terrorism. Other extremists linked to the mosque include Uthman Mustafa Kamal, the son of hate preacher Abu Hamza, who has regularly led prayers at An-Noor.\",\n",

The 20-year-old right back left the Catalan giants four years ago as he pursued a faster route to first-team football, eventually opting for Arsenal in the Premier League. But now, it seems Barca fans are keen for the Spaniard to return to the Nou Camp as they voted the youth international as their preferred choice to replace Dani Alves should the Brazilian leave the club. Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin has been linked with a return to former club Barcelona . PSG and Man United target Dani Alves could leave the Catalan giants as his contract expires this summer . In a poll carried out by Spanish publication 'Sport', Bellerin carries 12 per cent of the vote, with Glen Johnson also included with a mere two per cent. A move would see him follow the route of Cesc Fabregas, who also left Barca before ever playing a first-team game. However, it seems supporters would be happier if Alves stayed, with 62 per cent voting in favour of a contract renewal. The 31-year-old's current deal expires at the end of the season, with PSG and Manchester United potential suitors. Bellerin has been on a rapid road to success during the 2014/15 campaign for Arsenal, filling in for Mathieu Debuchy as the Frenchman struggled with injuries. He scored his second goal for the club against Liverpool on Saturday and is also improving defensively, with Arsene Wenger praising his contribution.

Play-off chasing Derby are planning for life without former England boss McClaren, who has been linked to jobs with Newcastle and Sunderland, and will make a concerted effort to get Dyche, who has impressed in the Premier League this season. Burnley host Tottenham on Sunday still fighting for top-flight survival, despite being written off as relegation certainties before the season began. Derby want Sean Dyche to replace Steve McClaren should the former England boss leave this summer . Dyche, 43, has won admirers for his plain speaking and organising a competitive team on a restricted budget.

              " {'sequence': \"The top of the Championship with five games to go . After another barmy day in the Championship we are still no closer to finding out which three clubs will be promoted to the Premier League. Eight sides still have a chance of claiming one of the two automatic promotion places, even with just five games left to play of the regular season. And then there are the play-offs – notoriously hard to call but surely even more so this season given the fine margins that separate this year's promotion-chasing crop. Regardless of who goes up though, there have been some stellar individual performances this season that will no doubt have attracted top flight attention. Here are eight players - one each from Bournemouth, Norwich, Watford, Middlesbrough, Derby, Wolves, Brentford and Ipswich - that could well be playing in the top flight next season regardless of whether their club goes up or not. Troy Deeney scores as Watford beat Middlesbrough on Monday in a crucial clash in the Championship . Matt Ritchie . Club: Bournemouth. Position: Winger. Age: 25. Games: 41. Goals: 11. Though left-footed, Ritchie operates on the right flank and his energy and eye for a goal sum up Eddie Howe's attacking side. A product of Portsmouth's academy, he never got a look-in at Fratton Park and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight. It was the Scotland international's £400,000 move to Bournemouth from Swindon in January 2013 that triggered Paolo di Canio's dramatic resignation at the County Ground. Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie celebrates as Bournemouth beat Birmingham on Easter Monday . Bradley Johnson . Club: Norwich. Position: Midfielder. Age: 27. Games: 38. Goals: 13. Norwich did well to hang on to Johnson after being relegated last summer and if they don't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the Premier League - where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this - come August. A powerful, deep-lying midfielder with a solid all-round game, the ex-Leeds man has added goals to his repertoire this season, scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons. Experienced midfielder Bradley Johnson has been in prolific form in front of goal this season . Troy Deeney . Club: Watford. Position: Striker. Age: 26. Games: 37. Goals: 20. Deeney has plundered 63 goals in the Championship in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the Premier League next season. A product of Walsall's academy, Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since. Deeney has been consistently excellent for Watford over the last three seasons . Patrick Bamford . Club: Middlesbrough. Position: Forward. Age: 21. Games: 34. Goals: 15. Having spent spells on loan from Chelsea at MK Dons, Derby and Boro in League One and now the Championship, the next step in Bamford's progression will be in the Premier League next season. If Boro go up, Jose Mourinho will surely be happy for the England Under 21 international to continue under the tutelage of his former No 2 and Boro boss Aitor Karanka. If not, there will be plenty of other suitors for the tall, versatile forward. Patrick Bamford (centre) moved to the Riverside on a season-long loan deal from Chelsea last summer . Will Hughes . Club: Derby. Position: Midfielder. Age: 19. Games: 39. Goals: 2. Not 20 until later this month, Hughes will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 side, for whom he has 14 caps. Making his debut as a 17-year-old, the elegant left-footed midfielder has already played over 130 times for Derby and has no shortage of admirers among the Premier League's elite. Derby midfielder Will Hughes has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager . Bakary Sako . Club: Wolves. Position: Winger. Age: 26. Games: 36. Goals: 13. When Sako moved to Wolves for £4million from St Etienne he would have had hopes of playing in the Premier League before too long. Instead, he found himself  in League One a year later. To his credit though, he stayed and spearheaded Wolves' romp to the League One title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back-to-back promotions. His contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if Wolves achieve that. Bakary Sako (centre) has become a cult hero at Molineux but looks certain to leave if Wolves don't go up . Alex Pritchard . Club: Brentford. Position: Attacking midfielder. Age: 21. Games: 41. Goals: 9. Another side bidding for back-to-back promotions are Brentford and Tottenham loanee Pritchard has been key in their surprise success story. Short, agile, quick and versatile, Pritchard is in the Spanish mould of midfielder we have been craving for so long in this country. Given Mauricio Pochettino's track record of developing youth it wouldn't be a surprise to see him in Spurs' squad next season though they may opt to loan him out  to a smaller Premier League club. Alex Pritchard takes on Liverpool's Emre Can during an Under 21 international last month . Tyrone Mings . Club: Ipswich. Position: Left back. Age: 22. Games: 35. Goals: 1. Linked with Arsenal and Crystal Palace in January, Mings' form has tailed off of late with Ipswich's but he has all the attributes required to succeed at the highest level. Tall for a full back at 6ft 5in Mings is nonetheless quick and full of attacking intent. He was let go by both Southampton and Bristol Rovers as a teen before arriving at Ipswich in 2012 via non-league. Giant Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings attracted interest from Premier League clubs in January . We’ve also come up with a composite XI made up by the best players from the eight clubs. This side would surely stay up in the Premier League with ease... Composite XI (4-2-3-1): John Ruddy (Norwich); Dominic Iorfa (Wolves), Russell Martin (Norwich), Steve Cook (Bournemouth), Tyrone Mings (Ipswich); Will Hughes (Derby), Bradley Johnson (Norwich); Matt Ritchie (Bournemouth), Alex Pritchard (Brentford), Bakary Sako (Wolves); Troy Deeney (Watford).\",\n",

Ten years on from his career-defining captaincy in the 2005 Ashes, Vaughan is the hot favourite to be appointed as director of England cricket, a streamlined version of the managing director's job which was abolished with Paul Downton's sacking on Wednesday. The 40-year-old has previously kept his distance from a formal role with the ECB, preferring to focus on his burgeoning media profile and business interests, but has declared himself open to discussions about the new post. Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen believes Michael Vaughan is the right man to lead England Cricket . Pietersen received the lion's share of attention during a photocall for his new club Surrey . The controversial star and Vaughan were England team-mates before Pietersen was axed by the ECB . Vaughan would be a pioneering presence, having spoken with passion and candour about the need to accept England's failings and press for change at all costs. That may yet prove good news for the exiled Pietersen. The controversial batsman has largely kept his counsel on the demise of Downton, whose first act in the job was to sack Pietersen last February. But he did tell BreatheSport that his 2005 Ashes captain Vaughan had the credentials to replace him. 'He (Vaughan) is close enough to the game to make changes which need to happen for the good of English cricket,' Pietersen said. 'The way he captained shows he'll change the brand of cricket currently being played, which we need.' Vaughan has previously concentrated on his media duties but is believed to be open to the role . The former England captain speaks with Stuart Broad during last summer's Test series with India . Vaughan holds the urn after England famously reclaimed the Ashes against Australia in 2005 . Pietersen may not have played international cricket for well over a year but his shadow looms large over the current turmoil surrounding England. Downton's troubled reign was defined by the decision to martyr Pietersen after the 2013/14 Ashes. The ECB board met at Lord's on Thursday, but there was no official word on the recruitment process. Instead a short statement merely confirmed that Giles Clarke's move from chairman to president had been rubber-stamped, with Middlesex deputy chairman Ian Lovett nominated as vice-chairman. Clarke will become the first ECB president on May 14, a role that carries responsibility for ICC business, while his old post will go to Colin Graves. Graves was the man who gave new legs to Pietersen's mooted comeback when he appeared to suggest a blank slate policy would take root when he arrived at Lord's. Graves hinted that a prolific run in county cricket could see him reinstated, which led to the 34-year-old extricating himself from his Indian Premier League contract and re-signing with Surrey. Downton's exit removed one significant obstacle and should Vaughan be handed the new position, that would strengthen his hand yet further. Former director of England Cricket, Paul Downton, was sacked after the nation's dismal World Cup . Another former England captain Alex Stewart has also put his hat into the ring for the vacancy . Surrey chief Alec Stewart, another former England captain who has indicated he would be open to talks with the ECB, is a confirmed Pietersen supporter - but another possible applicant, Andrew Strauss, is unlikely to be as effusive. Strauss' relations with Pietersen deteriorated badly in his final days as England captain, and an X-rated slip of the tongue during a commentary stint last summer suggested those wounds have not healed. There was no news from the board meeting on the future of national selector James Whitaker, who appeared vulnerable after Downton's dismissal. He looks set to continue in the role for the time being and is due to join the senior side in the West Indies for the second Test in Grenada and third in Barbados.\",\n",

After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets . Penrith-born Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964 . 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap... because Keith Miller never wore a cap, ' Benaud said at the time. 'It's one of those things in life: you live and learn as you go along.' As captain he led Australia to four consecutive series victories, beginning with a 4-0 demolition of Peter May's 1958-59 tourists (Benaud took 31 wickets in the five tests). He never lost a series as captain. Shane Warne penned a heartfelt tribute to Richie Benaud on social media on Friday .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Sebastian Vettel is determined to ensure the return of a long-standing ritual at Ferrari is not a one-off this season. Fresh from Ferrari's first victory in 35 grands prix in Malaysia 11 days ago, and ending his own 20-race drought, Vettel returned to a hero's welcome at the team's factory at Maranello last week. The win allowed Ferrari to revive a tradition not seen at their base for almost two years since their previous triumph in May 2013 at the Spanish Grand Prix courtesy of Fernando Alonso. Sebastian Vettel reflected on his stunning win for Ferrari at the Malaysian Grand Prix during the press conference before the weekend's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . The four-time world champion shares a friendly discussion with McLaren star Jenson Button . Four-times world champion Vettel said: 'It was a great victory we had in Malaysia, great for us as a team, and for myself a very emotional day - my first win with Ferrari. 'When I returned to the factory on Wednesday, to see all the people there was quite special. There are a lot of people working there and as you can imagine they were very, very happy. 'The team hadn't won for quite a while, so they enjoyed the fact they had something to celebrate. There were a couple of rituals involved, so it was nice for them to get that feeling again.' Asked as to the specific nature of the rituals, Vettel replied: 'I was supposed to be there for simulator work anyway, but it was quite nice to receive the welcome after the win. Ferrari's Vettel and Britta Roeske  arrive at the Shanghai circuit . Along with a Ferrari mechanic, Vettel caught up with members of his old team Red Bull on Thursday . 'All the factory got together for a quick lunch. It was quite nice to have all the people together in one room - it was a big room! - so we were able to celebrate altogether for a bit. 'I also learned when you win with Ferrari, at the entry gate, they raise a Ferrari flag - and obviously it's been a long time since they last did that. 'Some 10 years ago there were a lot of flags, especially at the end of a season, so this flag will stay there for the rest of the year. 'We will, of course, try and put up another one sometime soon.' Inside the Ferrari garage, Vettel shares a discussion with team staff as he looks to build on his Sepang win . Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene shares a conversation with Vettel at the team's hospitality suite . The feeling is that will not happen after this weekend's race in China as the conditions at the Shanghai International Circuit are expected to suit rivals Mercedes. Not that Vettel believes his success will be a one-off, adding: 'For here and the next races, we should be able to confirm we have a strong package and a strong car. 'We will want to make sure we stay ahead of the people we were ahead of in the first couple of races, but obviously knowing Mercedes are in a very, very strong position. 'In general, for the start of a season things can be up and down, and we want to make sure there is quite a lot of ups, not so many downs. 'But it's normal in some races you are more competitive than others. 'We managed to do a very good job in Malaysia, but for here and the next races we have to be realistic about we want to achieve.' Ferrari mechanics show their joy after Vettel won the Malaysian Grand Prix, helping record the team's first Formula One win since 2013 at the Spanish Grand Prix .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is braced for a ferocious derby clash at Old Trafford this weekend. The fading Barclays Premier League champions take on Manchester United on Sunday having unexpectedly fallen behind their arch-rivals in the table. For most of the season City, if not looking like mounting the strongest of title defences, at least seemed destined for a top-two finish. Manuel Pellegrini is relishing the prospect of taking on Manchester United with Manchester City on Sunday . David Silva (centre) leaves the pitch looking despondent after City's 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday . Sergio Aguero (centre) is blocked out by Damien Delaney (left) and James McArthur of Palace . That is now far from certain following a dramatic slump in fortunes while United, ordinary for much of the campaign, appear to have clicked into gear in the last month. With just a point separating them in third and fourth, the stage is set for a battle of high intensity. Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult to have a more intense match than you have in the Premier League every week but of course you add a little bit more for a derby of the city. Both teams want to win. 'It is important to be the winning team in the city - that gives an extra plus for the game, not only intensity is better but quality. 'Both teams have very good players and both managers like to play an attacking system so I hope (for a good game for) the fans, for whom you play, and after that I hope we can win.' City have held the edge over United in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend. A win would also see them become the first club to beat United five times in a row in the Premier League. United had the last laugh over City after the first of their current sequence of derby wins by winning the league in 2013 but since then the blues have had the bragging rights. Pellegrini said: 'I think that they have a lot of respect for our team because last year it was the team that dominated not only the derby but I think we dominated also the Premier League. It is not easy for a team. 'In the last three years we won two and in the other we were runner-up. This year we have been runner-up the whole year. 'We have to play seven games more and we will see what happens at the end of the season and in which position we will stay, but I think for them, they must try to beat the team that has been better in the last few years.' City are likely to come up against an altogether different opponent than the Crystal Palace side that frustrated them last Monday. Louis van Gaal's United have been fluid of late, winning impressively against Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa to take their run of victories to five. Facing a side that is not inclined to sit back could suit City but Pellegrini is dismissive of suggestions that might make it easier than in their most recent away losses at Palace and Burnley. The Chilean said: 'You never know but I don't think it will be easy. It will be different. 'United are a big team that like to play - especially with Van Gaal. He's always an attacking manager. We hope we will see a good game. 'We have a different problem, we have to make sure we don't make mistakes because they have important and technically very good players.' Despite a wretched run of just four league wins in 11 games since pulling level at the top with Chelsea on New Year's Day, Pellegrini maintains all possibilities remain open to his side. City boss Pellegrini remains positive about City's achievements this season despite dropping down to fourth . Vincent Kompany is an injury doubt for Manchester City's clash against Manchester United on Sunday . 'I never think in a negative way,' said the 61-year-old, who will await the outcome of a fitness test on captain Vincent Kompany's hamstring injury. 'I don't think of one, two or three points difference when you have to play seven games. 'When you have mathematical options in football you must never give up and always believe you can do it.'\",\n",

The 50-year-old needs just two more wins to achieve the fourth promotion of a career that has been mostly spent rescuing clubs from relegation after goals by Kieran Agard, Joe Bryan and Aaron Wilbraham clinched a local derby victory. In front of a sold-out Ashton Gate, City took revenge for a bitterly fought 1-0 defeat back in November which ended their unbeaten start to the season.

Booked: Turnbull, Kasim . Referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire) Attendance: 12,302 . That finished with Swindon chairman Lee Power accusing Cotterill of 'lacking class'. But it was the City boss who had the last laugh with a victory that left Swindon boss Mark Cooper having to pick his side up from two 3-0 defeats in four days that have finished their last hope of automatic promotion. Just to add to their woes they had both Yaser Kasim and Raphael Branco booked, meaning both will now serve suspensions. City had actually needed to ride their luck for much of the first half, with goalkeeper Frank Fielding pulling off three saves in two frantic minutes at one point. And Swindon striker Andy Williams cost Cooper's side their best chance of going in front when he cashed in on a mistake by Aden Flint to go through. He should have squared the ball back to strike partner Michael Smith who couldn' t have missed but instead tried to go it alone and gave Fielding the chance to save. Bristol City striker Kieran Agard (centre) celebrates giving his side the 1-0 lead against Swindon Town . Ben Gladwin (left) brings the ball for Swindon as Bristol City's Joe Bryan (centre) gives chace in midfield . As if that miss wasn't frustrating enough for the visitors, they were then architects of their own downfall when City took the lead on 35 minutes. Yaser Kasim was put under pressure as Swindon tried to play the ball out from the back from a goal kick, and gave it away to Joe Bryan. The young wing back hit a perfect pass to send Agard clear to make no mistake with his 11th goal of the season. City had earned that goal for the way they worked to put pressure on defenders, and they made their own luck again when Derrick Williams stretched to divert Ben Gladwin's shot onto the underside of the bar. Swindon's strike partnership of Williams and Smith had shared 36 goals and it wasn't hard to see why as their movement constantly troubled City's defence. But Williams, who had 21 of them, couldn't quite find his shooting range and put another gilt edged opportunity over the bar just after half time when Massimo Luongo had sent him clear. But that summed up the story of the night with no end product to so much possession, and the game swung back City's way when Jordan Turnbull turned Bryan's cross onto the top of his own bar. With 11 minutes gone Bryan wriggled into some space on the edge of the box, put the ball onto his left foot, and beat Wes Foderingham with a perfectly placed shot into the top corner. And the win was wrapped up when Luke Freeman reached the byline and cut the ball back for skipper Wilbraham to fire home his 19th of the season. Gladwin avoids the sliding tackle of Bristol City's Korey Smith with the home side still leading 1-0 on Tuesday .

This gritty, barely-deserved triumph helped Barcelona stay four points ahead of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, after Ancelotti’s side's almost-harrowing 9-1 demolition of Granada . Celta Vigo’s aggressive pressing nearly paid dividends, but their hard-work and effort counted for nothing thanks to Mathieu’s goal. Their frustration manifested itself in a bizarre way, with Fabian Orellana sent off for throwing a lump of turf at Sergio Busquets. For some reason Sergio Alvarez, Celta Vigo's goalkeeper, is kryptonite for Barcelona's attacking trident, as they also failed to beat him in 90 minutes at the Camp Nou earlier this season. After Barcelona's Halloween nightmare against Celta Vigo, the directive from Luis Enrique here was not to leave with egg on their faces on Easter Sunday. Barcelona's own website stated that 'a dose of retribution' was in order, after the 1-0 defeat by Eduardo Berizzo’s side in late autumn. Before the game Spanish media wondered if the international break had happened at just the wrong time for Barcelona and just the right time for Real Madrid – something reflected in Madrid’s big win at lunchtime. The Frenchman wheels away in celebration of his second half header at the Balaidos Stadium . Gerard Pique (right) and Sergio Busquets join the French defender in celebration of his goal . With Los Blancos in disarray, a couple of weeks spent healing wounds away from the Santiago Bernabeu seemed an agreeable plan, while Barcelona's momentum was disrupted. Jordi Alba was injured playing for Spain, so Adriano Correia started in his stead. Messi, meanwhile, was dragged round the United States with Argentina, sidelined because of an inflamed foot which left him unable to put his boots on. He managed to do that here, but his presence was barely noticed on the pitch. With rival Cristiano Ronaldo scoring an incredible five goals earlier, Messi was left frustrated in his quest for the golden boot, with the Madrid man four strikes ahead of him on 36. Luis Enrique hasn't shown himself to be the sentimental type, but the former Celta Vigo manager gave Rafinha Alcantara a rare start against the team which he played for, both before moving to Barcelona at 13, and last season on loan. However, the midfielder failed to impress and made way for the legendary Xavi early in the second half. Mathieu (left) is congratulated by team-mates Lionel Messi and Neymar (right) after his goal . Javier Mascherano was suspended for accumulating too many yellow cards, as is his wont, but luckily for Barcelona Busquets was fit enough to start for the first time in over a month. Alvarez turned in the display of his life at the Camp Nou and Barcelona's attacking trident must have worried it was going to happen again, when he made a brilliant diving stop to deny Lionel Messi. Profligacy was an issue in that 1-0 defeat too, which we were reminded of when Neymar slashed the rebound high and wide. Los Celestes had made the early running themselves and Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who boasts the best defensive record in La Liga, was down quickly to deny Joaquin Larrivey at his near post. It was Larrivey that put the first goal of the season past Bravo at the Camp Nou and he was determined not to let the Celta forward in again. With Messi quiet, it was down to the other two prongs of Barcelona's trident to try and make inroads. Neither were successful. Fabian\\xa0Orellana was shown a red card for throwing a chunk of grass in the direction of Sergio Busquets . The lump of turf strikes Busquets in the neck after tempers reached boiling point . Neymar antagonised the Celta Vigo fans as he drew several fouls, but the Barcelona ones too with his incredible wastefulness. To watch him in recent weeks is to see a different player to the one that dismantled La Liga defences earlier in the season. His first touch was frequently poor, his passes off-target. Suarez, meanwhile, went down in the box looking for a penalty under an arm from Gustavo Cabral, but far too little contact to actually tumble. He was then booked on the stroke of half-time for a dive, although this time he has been charged into. The one opportunity Suarez got he hit hard and true, stinging the palms of Alvarez. But Celta Vigo were on top and Nolito was getting the better of Dani Alves time and time again. Maybe the Brazilian's mind is elsewhere, with his contract expiring in the summer, but physically he seems less capable too. Orellana (right) leaves the field after referee\\xa0Inaki Vicandi Garrido brandishes a red card . The Barcelona players surround referee following a controversial decision . One horrendous defensive mix-up left Nolito charging for the ball with Bravo. The keeper got his foot to it before colliding with the Celta Vigo man, but the fans screamed for a penalty, unsuccessfully. The offside flag being raised against Orellana led to a Celta goal being ruled out, but the best chance fell to Larrivey before the interval. Orellana cut the ball neatly across the box but the striker, unmarked, nine yards out, lacked composure, hacking at it and sending it into the Vigo night sky. Barcelona continued to struggle, with Neymar’s goal harshly ruled out for offside and a shanked Alves shot the only efforts to their credit. Messi and Neymar react after another missed opportunity during a frustrating evening for the duo . Then came Pique’s tackle on Charles, with the defender making a super-human effort to get back and deny the striker. Celta Vigo were almost instantly punished for it, with Mathieu breaking the deadlock. Barcelona couldn’t kill the game, even after Orellana’s late sending off, with Messi scooping the ball over Alvarez but inches over the crossbar too. It didn’t matter; they held on to earn the three points and maintain the four-point lead over Real Madrid that they started the week with. And one game less for each side to play. It’s not pretty, it’s not ‘the Barca way’, but if Enrique lifts La Liga, nobody will be worrying about that.

Scroll down for video . Eyes on the prize: High-wire performer Nik Wallenda announces his latest stunt at the 400-foot Orlando Eye, during a news conference, in New York on Monday . Tough challenge: The 36-year-old daredevil will walk atop the Orlando Eye as it turns on April 29 . The Orlando Eye team issued a statement saying it's excited to have Wallenda attempt the 'amazing stunt.'

Wallenda previously walked atop a Ferris wheel in Santa Cruz, California, but he said the size of the much larger Orlando wheel and the fact that he will not use a pole sets this stunt apart. The seventh-generation member of the 'Flying Wallenda' family of acrobats has walked across the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. In November, he walked twice between two Chicago skyscrapers without a net or harness, doing the second walk blindfolded.

              " {'sequence': \"Has this brilliant 79th Masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on Sunday? No-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round, when the three biggest names in the sport combined with Justin Rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old Texan Jordan Spieth. The young American coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner Rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage. But there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to Rose but Masters specialist Phil Mickelson, who will start five behind. Spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round. It worked out perfectly for Tiger Woods in 1997 but not so well for Rory McIlroy in 2011, who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes. ‘I think Jordan will cope better than I did because he was in the final group last year,’ said McIlroy. ‘I certainly expect him to cope a lot better than I did.’ Jordan Spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters . At 16 under par, Spieth broke the record shared by Ray Floyd and Tiger Woods by a single shot . The other thing Spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round. He won one and finished runner-up in the other two. If he wins, he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with Rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun. Spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play. But while Rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes, Spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th. And at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three, before Spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous Masters Sunday. Plucky journeyman Charley Hoffman lies fourth while Woods and McIlroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on Sunday. But at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind. As for Rose, the 2013 US Open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish. Pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th, where he holed a spectacular bunker shot. ‘I think it’s important to be in the final group, it’s where you want to be,’ said the 34 year old Englishman. ‘Jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but I have definitely given myself an opportunity.’ World No 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods were in a five-way tie for fifth . Finally, the real McIlroy showed upon the par fives at Augusta on Saturday . What a day we had on Saturday. It was as if Rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared: ‘Ok, let’s see if this kid Jordan is really destined for greatness.’ For those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket, we had McIlroy playing like the world number one and Tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream. There was the glorious sight of Mickelson playing once more like he owns Augusta. And then there was Rose, who has had a lot of good days at Augusta in his ten Masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more. How would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror, at this of all courses? In short, for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in Spieth’s direction. This was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round. Just as well, then, that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be: ’Whenever the heat is on, ensure you focus just that little bit more.’ And that, for the most part, is just what he did. Only at the end did he look like stumbling, but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat. Tiger Woods put on a vintage show, he was\\xa0astonishing, electric, inspired and charismatic . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn showed her support during the third round on Saturday . The previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by Ray Floyd in 1976 and Woods in 1997. But the youngest first round leader in Masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on Friday had reached 16 under after a 70. What made this so impressive was that, for the first time, a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game. During the round he would have three three putts and his first double. When things like this happen here it’s so easy for the mind to unravel but Spieth kept his composure. At the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth. At the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot, from a downhill lie to an elevated green. Spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots. In its own way, this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds. So it continued. The two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag. You can guess what happened next, and he birdied the 13th as well. He would threeputt the 14th, however – and then came the next test. Phil Mickelson played like the Masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under . Justin Rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under . As he made his way down the 15th fairway, first Mickelson and then Rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures. How would he respond? Well, at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie. Best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie. McIlroy, Woods and Mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots. Mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of Arnold Palmer. Some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and Mickelson was doing justice to the memory. Eight strokes off the pace at the start of play, he’s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today. Add McIlroy’s wonderful back nine 31 from Friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday, and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63. Amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round. So tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake, it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided: ‘To hell with it, let’s go for it.’ Finally, the real McIlroy showed up on the par fives, those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years. An eagle at the 13th on Friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round. He was off and running. He birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the Masters. A poor eight iron to the 16th cost him, however, as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably. Another bogey at the last as well meant a 68. And so the likely list of winners stands at just three – Spieth, Rose and Mickelson. It should be some final day. It has been some tournament.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Glasgow Warriors have confirmed that experienced duo Al Kellock and Dougie Hall will both start Friday night's Guinness PRO12 match with Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun. Both skipper Kellock and Hall - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of May and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers. And while Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was naming his full squad for the Blues match on Thursday, he announced that the second-row and hooker would start in the pack against the Welsh outfit. Glasgow Warriors veteran Al Kellock will start at lock against Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night . The encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and, in a nice touch by the club, the match ball will be presented by Kellock's dad and Hall's mum along with Alistair Johnson, who was Kellock's best man, and Bernie Mitchell, who was an inspirational figure for Hall coming through at Hillhead/Jordanhill. Having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 Scotland caps, Hall admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign. 'You get to a point where you start thinking to yourself 'this could be the last game of rugby I ever play' so you want to make the most of it,' the 34-year-old said. 'I really want to enjoy these last few games, but also stay focused and help the Warriors secure a play-off place and hopefully the trophy. Glasgow hooker Dougie Hall is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby . As retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game. You start to think about your last team huddle, the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that I will miss incredibly.' Since he first played in the equivalent of the PRO12 for Edinburgh Rugby back in 2002/03 Hall has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly. As a result, despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table, he does not expect an easy night, far from it. 'They have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year,' he explained. 'We really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play-offs in the coming weeks. 'I hope that gone are the days when the PRO12 is looked on as a lesser league, the teams and the talent involved now really is top class.' Gregor Townsend's Glasgow side are currently top of the Pro12 standings ahead of Cardiff's visit . This season Hall has been restricted to seven appearances in the PRO12 for the Warriors to date, Fraser Brown and Pat MacArthur playing the majority of minutes with Kevin Bryce also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey. And while Hall himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio, he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run-in and in the play-offs. 'The last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym,' Hall explained. 'For me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field I can give it everything. 'As you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group, but I like to think I have acted like that since I came to the Warriors in 2007. Wales prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for Cardiff as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain . 'I was the starting hooker for a number of years and as Pat, and more recently, Fraser and Kevin have come in I hope they have learnt from watching what I do and also have learnt from what I say too.' Meanwhile, Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match with a calf strain. The injury forced the Wales and British & Irish Lions' man off last week in his side's European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat to the Dragons. 'Gethin has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought. He hasn't trained this week so is a doubt, but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season,' Blues attack coach Paul John said. 'We want to play to a game plan, execute well and perform to the best of our ability. To do justice to the league we have to do that. 'Glasgow are a good offloading side, they are a complete side in many ways, and we've got to control the ball better than we did last weekend.'\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Louis van Gaal couldn’t let the moment pass. Manchester United had just rattled off their 13th home win of the season and the Dutchman wanted to crank up the pressure. A comfortable victory over Aston Villa, inspired by two goals from the excellent Ander Herrera and crowned by Wayne Rooney’s magnificent strike, had seen United leap above Manchester City in the table for the first time since November 23, 2013. When you think on January 10 this year the gap between the two clubs was 10 points, the turnaround has been remarkable. But now, as they head into their latest local squabble, there is mounting confidence around Old Trafford that United will not surrender their position. Louis van Gaal has piled pressure on Manchester City ahead of their games against Crystal Palace and United . Manchester United picked up all three points at the weekend by beating Aston Villa 3-1 at Old Trafford . Van Gaal believes Manchester City's players may struggle to get to grips with being in fourth spot . MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3): De Gea 6; Valencia 7, Jones 7, Rojo 7, Blind 7: Herrera 8.5, Carrick 7, Fellaini 6.5 (Falcao 77mins): Mata 7.5, Rooney 8, Young 6.5 (Di Maria 70. 6.5) Subs not used: Valdes, Rafael, Januzaj, McNair, Pereira .

Subs not used: Given, Vlaar, Gil, Grealish . Booked:\\xa0Delph . Scorer: Benteke 80 . Man of the match: Ander Herrera . Referee: Roger East 6 . Is it feasible for City to finish fourth? They face Crystal Palace on Monday evening and Van Gaal believes dropping down two positions will creep into the psychology of Manuel Pellegrini’s squad. Even if City win at Selhurst Park, how will they handle the furnace that awaits this Sunday? ‘It plays a part in the spirit of the players — of our opponents but also our players,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We have more confidence now and when (if) they lose a point against Crystal Palace, then it is also sitting in their minds. ‘I don’t know the individual players of Manchester City so well, so I cannot judge them. But we have a lot of confidence and we haven’t lost so many times at home. The next game is going to be the decisive game.’ Van Gaal is aware recent history spells doom for United. They have lost seven of the last nine Manchester derbies, including each of the last four. Remarkably, they have not beaten City at home since Rooney scored that breath-taking bicycle kick in February 2011. City, few would dispute, have the better squad but, regardless of what happens in south London, will they be able to hold United’s momentum? Can they match their spirit? Big games are bringing the best out of Van Gaal’s men and they are clearly relishing the opportunity that awaits. Manchester United have not beaten City at Old Trafford since Wayne Rooney's wonder goal in February 2011 . Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero scored in his side's 1-0 win over United back in November . Rooney likes playing against Villa — this was his 13th career goal against them. Newcastle (12) are his second favourite opponents. Man United lead rivals Man City by one point . ‘It was another Manchester United, I believe,’ said Van Gaal, when asked how he reflected on the 1-0 defeat he suffered at the Etihad Stadium in November. ‘We have developed the team. That was more in the start of the process and now we are in the end of the process. ‘So I think also the confidence of our players is very high at the moment but also our performances shows that so it’s not the same Manchester United. It’s like the game against Liverpool and the game (coming up) against Chelsea — you have to win these kinds of matches.’ With Liverpool’s defeat by Arsenal effectively ending the doubt over which sides will finish in the top four, it now becomes a question of what order Chelsea, Arsenal and the two Manchester clubs will be after the final games have been played. United’s run-in is laced with demanding assignments — aside from City, they must go to Stamford Bridge on April 18, face a trip to Goodison Park the following week and host Arsenal on May 16 — but they have an aura once more. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling saw red during the Premier League clash at the Etihad Stadium . Man United vs Man City - April 12 . Chelsea vs Man United - April 18 .

Man City vs QPR - May 10 . Swansea vs Man City - May 17 . Man City vs Southampton - May 24 . Villa, stymied by injury problems that Tim Sherwood described as ‘crippling’, simply couldn’t cope once they went conceded in the 43rd minute and the manager, who was noticeably glum afterwards, can at least take solace from the fact Queens Park Rangers will not offer the same threat on Tuesday. ‘We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, it’s going to be a great game,’ said Ashley Young, who admitted he was ‘disappointed’ to not be selected for the last round of England games. ‘Hopefully we will get the three points. Of course it would be nice but we are just taking each game as it comes.’ There was never any hint they would slip up here, bossing the first half and then going through the gears after a slow period after the break to swat Villa aside. Herrara, with his slick passing and industry, was terrific.

Neymar, who scored his side's second goal with a curling free kick, was replaced with the score at 2-1 and 15 minutes to play. Sevilla then scored a late equaliser, and Neymar 'can't understand why he is subbed so much' reports Spanish paper Sport. Neymar's dispute with Luis Enrique features prominently in Spain, while they look ahead to the Madrid derby . The paper points out that the forward has been replaced in 15 of his 34 matches this season, with only Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta being substituted more. With Barcelona still top of La Liga, and challenging for a treble, the paper points out that the club will need to be united in the final run-in. Elsewhere in Spain the attention is focused on the Madrid derby in this week's Champions League quarter-finals. Marca claims that the game is 'like a final', with the two teams playing out a repeat of last year's showdown in Lisbon, while in AS, Real defender Pepe calls for intensity and humility. In Italy the headlines are dominated by Lazio, who moved above their city rivals Roma into second place in Serie A with a win over Empoli . AS also look ahead to the Champions League quarter-final, while in Italy the focus is on Lazio's win .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Gary Hooper came off the bench to snatch a dramatic stoppage-time winner to keep Norwich City on track for automatic promotion in the Sky Bet Championship after Neil Lennon's battling Bolton came within minutes of gaining a point. Former Celtic star Hooper's goal sparked jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench in contrast to the dejection of his one-time Parkhead boss Neil Lennon. Indeed, Hooper had been a transfer target for Lennon earlier in the season so his winning goal was a double blow for the Ulsterman. Gary Hooper celebrates after earning Norwich three points with a stoppage-time winner against Bolton . Former Celtic striker Hooper is mobbed by his team-mates as Norwich remained second in the Championship . Bolton:\\xa0Bogdan, Vela, Dervite, Ream, Moxey, Bannan, Walker (Janko 87), Feeney, Gudjohnsen (Danns 82), Heskey, Le Fondre . Subs not used:\\xa0Lonergan, M Davies, Trotter, Rochinha, McCarthy .

Subs not used:\\xa0Rudd, E Bennett, O'Neil, Odjidja-Ofoe . Booked: Bennett . Scorer(s): Dorrans 9, Hooper 90+ . Referee: James Adcock . Graham Dorrans gave the Canaries an early lead as his right-footed free-kick deflected off Josh Vela into the net, but Adam Le Fondre looked to have rescued a point and extended Bolton's unbeaten run to four games. Instead, Hooper lobbed keeper Adam Bogdan - as the Wanderers defenders switched off - to score an invaluable goal. Lennon had promised his side would spoil a few parties in the remaining games of the season with Brantford and Bournemouth coming up in the next few weeks. That looked to be the case until Hooper's strike made it five wins in the last six meetings between the teams. Norwich made the perfect start with Dorrans' deflected free-kick after Vela took down Nathan Redmond on the edge of the area. The Canaries should have doubled their advantage six minutes later as Sebastien Bassong rose highest at a corner but cleared Bogdan's crossbar by some distance. Hooper lobs the ball over Adam Bogdan to spark jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench . Former West Brom midfielder Graham DOrrans celebrates after giving the visitors the lead on Saturday . And the visitors were in total control when Wanderers drew level totally against the run of play. It was so one-sided manager Lennon was poised to bring on Neil Danns to shore up his midfield. Instead, youngster Tom Walker, who had been guilty of delaying a cross moments earlier, learned his lesson. His flashing centre from the left picked out Le Fondre inside the six-yard box and the on-loan Cardiff City striker, back in the side after missing the Easter Monday trip to South Wales, finished with ease. Walker continued to prove a threat to the visitors' defence with his elusive running and was harshly booked for a foul on Wes Hoolahan. Liam Feeney shot narrowly wide from another Walker cross that fizzed beyond three static Norwich defenders before the Canaries rediscovered their composure. Top scorer Cameron Jerome, whose double won the reverse fixture at Carrow Road last October, brought a smart save out of Bogdan while the Hungarian international needed treatment after punching away another dangerous-looking Dorrans free-kick. Norwich striker Cameron Jerome heads towards goal during the clash at the Macron Stadium . The second half was much more competitive and Wanderers were more of a match for their high flying visitors. So much so that Neil brought on Lewis Grabban after 57 minutes for Hoolahan. And Grabban made an immediate impact, bringing out a save from Bogdan before Tim Ream cleared off the line from first-half scorer Dorrans. However, Bolton had their moments going forward too with Le Fondre trying cheekily to chip John Ruddy while Alex Tettey cleared off the line after Dorian Dervite narrowly failed to connect with Walker's corner. Neil's intention's were clear and with 20 minutes left had made his full set of substitutions with Hooper replacing Nathan Redmond and Steven Whittaker going off for Ryan Bennett. The visitors were incensed they did not get a penalty when Russell Martin's cross hit Dean Moxey on the hand. But any ill luck was cancelled out in injury time as hot shot Hooper slotted his winner.\",\n",

And since taking over at Real Sociedad Moyes has enhanced his reputation as a manager who brings, if nothing else, solidity. In his 21 La Liga games to date Sociedad have conceded just 29 times, climbing from the relegation when Moyes took over, to an extremely comfortable tenth place. Mikel Gonzalez diverts a corner past his own goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli who fails to punch it away . Atletico Madrid celebrate after going two goals ahead after just 10 minutes, killing the match as a contest . Antoine Griezmann (left) is congratulated by Fernando Torres, but didn't celebrate against his former club . Atletico Madrid: Oblak; Gimenez, Miranda, Siqueira, Gamez; Suarez, Tiago, Koke, Turan (Niguez 81 mins); Griezmann (Gabi 90), Torres (Jimenez 61) Subs not used:\\xa0Ansaldi, Bernabe, Cani, Hernandez . Goals: Gonzalez (OG) 2, Griezmann 10 . Booked: Turan . Real Sociedad: Rulli; Gonzalez, Elustondo, Yuri, Zadldua; Bergara, Ruben Pardo; Zurutuza (Finnbogason 74), Canales (Agirretxe 74), Xabi Prieto; Castro (Granero 81) Subs not used: Martinez, Hervias, Estrada, Zubikarai . Yet, on Tuesday night, Sociedad showed none of the qualities usually associated with their manager, capitulating inside 10 minutes against the Spanish champions. By the time Antoine Griezmann struck the hosts' second goal, lifting the ball over the hapless Geronimo Rulli after the keeper had parried Koke's shot straight to the Frenchman, Atletico could have been four up, and the game was all but over. Arda Turan had already seen his volley hit the post after being left totally unmarked from a free kick, before Mikel Gonzalez diverted the resulting corner past his own keeper after little more than 90 seconds. Soon after Griezmann narrowly failed to connect with a header after yet more shocking set-piece defending, and the former Sociedad man also came close to tricking his way through the visiting defence, only to be denied by a last-ditch tackle. David Moyes looks on as his team showed uncharacteristic defensive frailties at the Vicente Calderon . Mario Suarez holds off Sociedad forward Sergio Canales as Atletico took control and never relinquished it . Atletico Madrid's Turkish star Arda Turan, who struck the post early on, takes of Gorka Elustondo . Against a team who hadn't conceded a single goal in their previous four games, it was suicidal. In response Moyes' side produced next to nothing. Chory Castro brought a save from Atletico's Slovenia keeper Jan Oblak which was comfortable enough, while Sergio Canales swung a leg at a dropping ball from inside the area, only to see it fly well wide. That was about all they managed until a free kick from one-time QPR midfielder Estaban Granero forced Oblak into his first stretching save with three minutes to play. The champions, on the other hand, without looking particularly good, continued to threaten, helped repeatedly by Rulli and his defenders, who seemed desperate to offer chances out of nothing. Mario Suarez was given the freedom of the penalty area from another corner, but couldn't make contact with his volley, before Rulli misjudged a wayward Koke cross, allowing it to land on his crossbar. Torres worked hard and offered a foil for the talented Griezmann before being replaced after an hour . Diego Simeone calls for more for his team as they kept their La Liga title defense alive . The Argentine stopper also flapped at a cross, allowing Guilherme Siqueira an opportunity from close range, but the full-back saw his shot deflected wide. The win means Atletico are only two points behind city rivals and Champions League quarter-final opponents Real Madrid, although Carlo Ancelotti's side have a game in hand, and the defence of their title is not yet over. Diego Simeone was able to rest Fernando Torres for the final 30 minutes, after the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker had run hard, without much success, alongside Griezmann. His side's season will be defined in the coming weeks, while Moyes' early successes in Sociedad means Real's campaign has already reached a successful conclusion, with survival assured. But his side's defending will nonetheless have hurt the former Manchester United manager.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid couldn't be separated in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final showdown on Tuesday. The two giants from the Spanish capital played out a goalless draw, meaning all is left to play for in the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu. Here, Sportsmail rates the players in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final at the Vicente Calderon. ATLETICO MADRID . Jan Oblak 9 -\\xa0Blocked everything in the first half as a wind-assisted Real Madrid looked like putting the tie beyond doubt in the first 45 minutes. Had less to do in the second half but did it well. A man of the match display from the 22-year-old. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a big save to deny Gareth Bale in the early minutes . Juanfran 7 - He was rattled, along with the rest of the team, in the first half but he played his part in keeping Madrid at bay. Miranda 7 -\\xa0Will not have put any watching suitors off with another solid display alongside Godin - that is the third time this season Real have failed to score against Atletico Madrid at the Calderon and Miranda is a major reason for that. Diego Godin 7 -\\xa0A rare slip early on let Bale in but the Welshman failed to punish the Uruguayan and he recovered well to marshall the team to another clean sheet against the European champions. At times in the first half he must have been seeing flashbacks of extra time in Lisbon but came through without conceding. Atletico Madrid centre-back Diego Godin rises higher than Sergio Ramos to attempt a header on goal . Guilherme Siqueira 6\\xa0-\\xa0No mystery why Diego Simeone wants Felipe Luis back at the club next\\xa0season.\\xa0Siquiera is a threat going forward but a liability defensively and will be replaced in the summer. Arda Turan 7\\xa0-\\xa0Always bright going forward and tested Casillas in the second period with a shot the Spain keeper did well to save. Will be vital in nicking a goal at the Bernabeu next week. Mario Suarez 6 -\\xa0Forced a fine second-half save from Casillas but was just as blown away by Real in the first 45 minutes. Will still be a steal for someone at the end of the season if, as expected, he moves on. Gabi 6 -\\xa0Simeone's soldier worked hard in defence in the first period but maybe lacked invention in the second period as Atletico took the\\xa0initiative. Cristiano Ronaldo is crowded out by Atletico Madrid's Mario Suarez (left) and Gabi . Koke 6\\xa0-\\xa0Currently struggling to live up to those 'new Xavi' tags. Still a tremendous prospect and gave as good as he got against Real's trio of Modric, James and Kroos. Antoine Griezmann 7\\xa0-\\xa0You can see why he has scored 21 goals this season in a little over 40 games. He is always bright and showed pace and surprising strength in the first period to pull away from Ramos. Tough to play against and he will be important for Atletico on the break at the Bernabeu. Mario Mandzukic 7\\xa0-\\xa0The old warhorse was elbowed by Ramos, bitten and punched by Carvajal and booked for complaining. He was a bloody hero too and had to be bandaged up midway through the second half. Still lacks that pace to pull away into space that Diego Costa has. Substitutes:\\xa0Raul Garcia (Griezmann 77), Torres (Koke 83). Not used: Moya, Tiago, Saul, Jesus Gamez, Gimenez. REAL MADRID . Iker Casillas 7-\\xa0Stayed awake in the first half as Real poured forward but Atletico Madrid still threatened on the break. Also kept out Mario Suarez' late shot as Real managed to hang on. Iker Casillas makes a save as Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres goes for the ball . Dani Carvajal 7 -\\xa0Was used as an auxiliary winger in the first 45 minutes as Real tried to take advantage of Siqueira’s weakness. Also scrapped at the back and landed a punch and a bite on Manzukic as tempers frayed. That might still cost him his place in the second leg. Raphael Varane 8\\xa0-\\xa0Real Madrid's best performer. We knew he was quick but how quick! His first half sprint down the right was worthy of Bale. Is there a quicker defender in Europe at the moment? Quite possibly not. When Pepe pulled out before the start of the game many Real Madrid fans would have feared the worst but Varane never put a foot wrong. Raphael Varane was in excellent form for Real Madrid in defence at the Vicente Calderon . Sergio Ramos 6 -\\xa0Left trailing in Griezmann’s wake early on but was a match for Mandzukic. Solid but without the heroics of Lisbon and that last-minute goal. Marcelo 7 -\\xa0Asked to attack less in the first half with Carvajal trying to do more damage on the other flank. Did all that was asked of him defensively without shining going forward as he can do. Booked and will not play second leg. Luka Modric 7\\xa0-\\xa0Majestic in the first half as Madrid dominated but faded like his team in the second. Still the most complete midfielder that Real Madrid have and they were never going to lose 4-0 as they did in February without him. He will be vital in the second leg. Luka Modric was majestic in the first half for Real Madrid, but he faded along with the team in the second . Toni Kroos 6\\xa0-\\xa0A shame that he has less license to attack in his current incarnation as Madrid’s holder. Covered ground, got Madrid passing and still managed a shot that Oblak saved, but wouldn't he have more influence on games if he played slightly further forward? James Rodriguez 6 -\\xa0Only just back from injury and it showed in the second half. Could easily have made way for Isco, who eventually replaced Benzema. Has magic in his boots and had a fine chance to win it on the night but couldn't take it. Gareth Bale 7 -\\xa0Provided cross after cross in the first half as he tormented Siqueira but they came to nothing and Madrid were left to rue the chance he had when Godin slipped and he was through on Oblak’s goal. He will be blamed because of that miss but worked hard and could still be key in the second leg with Atletico's weakness at left back. Bale missed an excellent opportunity to give Real the lead and a priceless away goal . Karim Benzema 5\\xa0-\\xa0Struggles to score against Atletico and was taken off in the second half as he once again failed to puncture their rearguard. Missed a fine chance in the second period when for some reason he flicked the ball back towards Ronaldo instead of trying to beat Oblak himself. Cristiano Ronaldo 6\\xa0- Had several free-kicks in the first half that failed to trouble Oblak, Also failed to connect with those excellent first-half crosses from Bale. Atletico Madrid are a tough nut to crack and the world’s most expensive forward line couldn’t find the vital away goal. Ronaldo was just as\\xa0responsible\\xa0as\\xa0Bale and Benzema for that. Substitutes:\\xa0Arbeloa (Carvajal 85), Isco (Benzema 76). Not used:\\xa0Navas, Pepe, Khedira, Jese, Illarramendi. Ronaldo endured a frustrating evening as he was unable to find a breakthrough for his team .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks. The must-have for IVF mums and dads these days, however, is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception. The images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life – from fertilisation to the division of cells, right through to the growth of an embryo. Hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these EmbryoScope images, which are also helping scientists learn more about the IVF process. Scroll down for video . Pictured is the very first cell division of Pixie Morley, now aged nine months, taken using the revolutionary EmbryoScope technology . Sally and Stephen Morley (pictured with their daughter Pixie) are one of some 1,500 couples in Britain who have had babies using EmbryoScope technology . Sally and Stephen Morley are among them. The grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their IVF baby, Pixie. A tiny camera, placed inside an incubator, films the reproduction process. As well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form, the technology – developed in the US – also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process. This narrows a mother’s chance of miscarrying. The Morleys, from Walsall, had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for IVF. Mrs Morley, 38, the head of a nursery, said: ‘I knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when I failed to get pregnant each month I knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible.’ While the couple were undergoing IVF, the EmbryoScope technology was introduced at the Midland Fertility Clinic, allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child’s conception on camera. The technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing. Pictured is the cell division of now nine-month-old Pixie . In October 2013, the embryo was transferred into Mrs Morley’s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful. Now, nine months after Pixie’s birth, she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived. Experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in IVF. Professor Simon Fishel, who is boss of Care Fertility, the first clinic in Britain to use the EmbryoScope, said: ‘We now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don’t make babies do different things. 'And to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us.’ Professor Fishel, who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, said the EmbryoScope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop – and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies. The videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent, Professor Fishel said. ‘The couple can see the process of fertilisation, see the cells divide, see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo…it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life.’ The video given to parents is a sped-up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops. Professor Fishel said his patients were ‘awestruck’ when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant. He added that, at across the Care Fertility clinics, 1,000 couples, who had gone on to have a baby, had been given footage of their embryo’s development.\",\n",

McNamara has faced a furious fan backlash in the past week amid a woeful run of results allied to the revelation that he receives a cut of transfer fees for United players sales. Since selling prize assets Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to Celtic for £2million on transfer deadline day, United have won just once, in a Scottish Cup tie at Stranraer. Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong has backed under-fire Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara . McNamara has faced a furious fan backlash in the past week amid a woeful run of results . After 10 games without a win, the heat was turned up on McNamara on Wednesday night when United lost 3-1 at Dens Park – their first derby defeat to Dundee since November 2004. However, as McNamara comes under increasing pressure from United fans, some of whom believe his position is untenable, Armstrong yesterday backed his old boss to ride out the most testing period of his managerial career. ‘Jackie McNamara is a good guy. He was always really nice to me when I was at United - and he is capable of turning it around,’ said the 23-year-old. Celtic unveil former Dundee Utd teammates Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven following their exit . ‘Yes, United are having woes just now. They are on a bad run of form, and the injuries aren’t really helping either. But these things happen in football. I am sure Jackie McNamara and United will turn it around – it’s just a matter of time.’ Asked yesterday if this spell was the toughest test so far of his managerial career, McNamara said: ‘Not really. We went through a spell last year but it’s things I’ll learn from. I am learning so it’s been good in that sense. ‘I’ve learned different things, reasons for things and different scenarios recently. I think that will stand me in good stead.’ Mackay-Steven (right) celebrates his goal with former Dundee United teammate John Rankin . Ex-United defender Mark Wilson, who also left Tannadice in January, insists the root of the current crisis at United has been their losing streak - not the manager’s controversial bonus scheme. United face Hamilton today, who have not won in 12 matches, and Wilson believes ‘bruised figure’ McNamara can win back the fans if he can restore his team to winning ways. ‘The bonus row doesn’t sit well with the fans,’ conceded Wilson. ‘But that’s purely because the team is losing. If the team was winning it would all be brushed under the carpet. ‘Does the manager look a bruised figure right now? Yes, but you can see why! He’ s built a successful attacking team and his players are getting ripped away. Former Dundee United ace Armstrong celebrates with Mackay-Steven after scoring for Celtic . 'You don’t know whether the players had clauses, or whether it’s been a decision made at the top of the club, but if you took Armstrong and Mackay Steven out of any team it would leave a massive hole. 'Take away Andrew Robertson and Ryan Gauld, who were sold last summer, that’s four mainstays of last year’s team now gone. ‘Those are big shoes to fill, and I’m sure the likes of Aidan Connolly and Blair Spitall, if given time, will do that. Jackie has shown he can go out and buy and rear genuine stars. I believe there is still enough quality there for United to grind out results and start climbing up the league.’\",\n",

With more sackings inevitable, Sportsmail asks: Who's next? Alastair Cook . Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign. The new ‘Director of England cricket’ might think Cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician. Verdict: Vulnerable. Alastair Cook was sacked as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign . Peter Moores . An atrocious World Cup heaped even more pressure on the coach, whose reappointment last year by Downton has been mitigated only by last summer’s Test series win against India. Described as ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’ by Downton, Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been. Verdict: Vulnerable. Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Kevin Pietersen . It is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport, this high-maintenance player could be on the brink of a return. But Downton’s removal, and Giles Clarke’s departure, means the path is now clear for Pietersen if he scores runs for Surrey. Verdict: Return possible. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in the hope of earning a place in the Ashes squad for England this summer . James Whitaker . The chairman of selectors and former Leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in English cricket. Selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well-publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players, spectators and media. Verdict: Sure to follow Downton out the door . The chairman of selectors James Whitaker (left) looks sure to follow Paul Downton through the exit door .\",\n",

Karabatic, a multiple world and Olympic gold medalist, and his younger brother Luka were among a group of players banned by the French league two years ago for betting on the result of a match in which their Montpellier club, which had already secured the title, lost to a struggling team. Karabatic's lawyer Michael Corbier told Sportsmail on Wednesday the trial will likely take place within months. French handball star Nikola Karabatic has been accused of match fixing along with 15 others . Former Montpellier ace competes for France in Handball World Cup match against Iceland in January . 'We would have preferred the charges to be thrown out, but we'll aim for a not-guilty verdict,' said Corbier. 'In theory he is facing five years in prison and a fine, but even a suspended sentence of just half an hour in jail would be too much.' Karabatic, who was briefly detained when the case emerged, now plays for Barcelona in the Spanish league. Karabatic leaves the Montpellier's courtroom after attending his appeal in October 2012 . Other former or current Montpellier players including Mladen Bojinovic, Samuel Honrubia, Dragan Gagic, Primoz Prost, Issam Tej and Mickael Robin will also be tried. Karabatic has denied placing bets on the match that Montpellier lost 31-28 to Cesson-Rennes.

Kerry Hamilton was finally diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma, a rare cancer of the soft tissue normally found in women over 50. At just 34, she was forced to undergo a hysterectomy and was devastated at the thought of not being able to have children. She now wants to raise awareness about rare cancers like leiomyosarcoma, so that other women with seemingly 'everyday' symptoms like cramps visit their GP. Kerry Hamilton, 34, had stomach cramps, bleeding and irregular periods for two years. Doctors finally discovered she had a tumour the size of a golf ball growing in her cervix . Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month (pictured) Since her time in South Africa (pictured) she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps . Ms Hamilton, from Birmingham, said: 'I'm on a bid to raise awareness about rare cancers and the symptoms that people might ignore - without realising that it is important to listen to their body. 'The kind of cancer I had - despite it being in my cervix - would not have showed up on a smear test. 'So it's important to visit your GP if you're concerned about anything, as well as always going for routine tests.' Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month. A week before she was due to fly home she fell violently ill with stomach cramps. She spent seven days in hospital where a local doctor told her that she was suffering with a cyst on her ovaries that had burst. Leiomyosarcomas are cancers that develop in a type of muscle tissue called smooth muscle. These muscles are found in the walls of muscular organs like the heart and the stomach. They are rare and usually only affect people over the age of 50, but they can start anywhere in the body. They most commonly start in the walls of the womb, the limbs and the digestive system. People with early leiomyosarcoma often have no symptoms. Possible . symptoms to develop as the cancer advances include a lump or swelling, . abdominal bloating, swelling or pain and a change in menstruation. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support . Over the next two years she returned to the park to work as a guide and a ranger and later returned to the UK where she started working as an educational consultant. When she returned, she went for a routine smear test in 2011 and was given the all clear. Ever since being hospitalised in South Africa she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps. By last summer these symptoms had become worse and intense pain and lots of bleeding. Her GP suggested it was a hormonal problem and that she go on the contraceptive pill to try and control it. But as she was single, Ms Hamilton didn't see the point of using a contraceptive and felt uneasy about taking hormonal treatment. She also didn't want to ignore the signals her body was giving her, and so never took the contraceptives that were prescribed. It was only in January this year, when she was called for her next smear test, that she was finally diagnosed. The nurse due to carry out the smear said her cervix was so irritated that it was impossible to conduct the test. Ms Hamilton, pictured in 2009, became aware something was seriously wrong when a nurse couldn't perform a smear test on her as there was so much inflammation . Doctors diagnosed Ms Hamilton with a leiomyosarcoma \\xa0- a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body . She then broke the devastating news that she suspected Ms Hamilton had cancer. After an MRI scan, doctors confirmed she had leiomyosarcoma and would need a hysterectomy to save her life. A leiomyosarcoma is a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body. Ms Hamilton's was found in the walls of her cervix. Only about 3,300 new cases of soft tissue cancers are diagnosed each year in the UK, and they mainly affect people over the age of 50. Ms Hamilton described the shock of being told she may never be able to become pregnant naturally. 'This was going to be the year I was going to go out and meet someone and start to think about having a family. 'But now I wouldn't be able to carry a child. 'I couldn't believe that I had cancer in my cervix for all that time.' Ms Hamilton underwent a hysterectomy at just 34-and was devastated at the thought of not being able to carry a child. But she remained positive, saying 'there is somebody else going through much worse' She underwent egg collection so that one day she might have a child that is biologically hers. On March 19th this year she underwent the operation to remove her womb – and the tumour – and is now recovering at home. While many women would become disheartened after such an ordeal, Ms Hamilton said she believes . She said: 'Luckily I am a naturally positive person, and I just think that there is somebody else going through something much worse than me. 'When I was finally diagnosed it was more of a relief than anything to know what was wrong. 'It was when I was told that I would need a hysterectomy that when it hit me, and I became really upset.' Even before she had cancer, Ms Hamilton ran the Race for Life for Cancer Research UK, and this year raising money for the charity will be more meaningful than ever. She said: 'I have done the race the last two years, and I always said I would do it every year, so this year I'm on a mission. 'I've already raised £1,600 which is so amazing and humbling.'

              " {'sequence': \"England must have played against worse teams than this St Kitts Invitational XI but, after a day that descended into near farce, it is difficult to think of any. Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts . Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England . The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap . Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out . Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead . For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the ‘contest,’ England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out. Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. Gary Ballance looked out of touch, the only real problem for England in a very comfortable match . Liam Plunkett charges in as England reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances . When St Kitts plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the Velcro on his pads barely fastened, the home side’s embarrassment was almost complete. Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England’s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner’s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid’s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week . Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days . The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England’s unimaginative one-day thinking. England’s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit. Truly, it is a sad state of affairs.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Hector Bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans, and possibly even by his manager, as Arsenal's premier right back, after impressing in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy. The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates . Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season . 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations. 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres . Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time . But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again . 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. But after his brilliant goal at the Emirates stadium last weekend, one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"The news that Jurgen Klopp will leave Borussia Dortmund in the summer has raised the probability that key members of his squad will depart too. Klopp has painstakingly built a team in his image during his seven-year tenure at the Westfalenstadion and achieved considerable success. Dortmund were Bundesliga champions in 2011 and 2012 before they reached the final of the Champions League in 2013. Jurgen Klopp has announced he is to quit Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season . Klopp has enjoyed seven successful seasons at the Westfalenstadion but has decided to call time . But the signings of Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski helped Bayern Munich re-establish their dominance and Klopp's exit is the end of an era. It could signal the break-up of the Dortmund squad and we take a look at four players who could follow Klopp out of the club this summer. MATS HUMMELS . Even before Klopp's shock announcement, it looked highly likely that Hummels would be leaving at the end of the season, most likely to Manchester United. The Germany World Cup-winner is considered one of the best defenders in the game and would add steel to any back line. Klopp revealed recently that Hummels, 26, had been 'thinking things over,' adding that he believed he was good enough for United. Defender Mats Hummels has been linked with a move to Manchester United this summer . ILKAY GUNDOGAN . The 24-year-old midfielder has also been linked with a summer move to the Premier League, with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City among those interested. At his best, Gundogan can take control of a midfield battle and is more than capable of unlocking defences with his range of passing. He hinted in February that he was ready to sign a new contract but then stalled and Klopp's departure could make up his mind for him. Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has been linked with a number of Premier League sides . CIRO IMMOBILE . The Italian striker only arrived at the Westfalenstadion from Torino last summer but hasn't lived up to expectations as Lewandowski's replacement. A measly return of 10 goals for the season has hardly compensated for the loss of their star striker to Bayern last summer. There have been suggestions that Dortmund will listen to offers for Immobile and he would most likely return home to Italy, perhaps to AC Milan. Ciro Immobile (left) has struggled to compensate for Robert Lewandowski's departure to Bayern Munich . NEVEN SUBOTIC . The Serbian defender had ears burning in the Premier League when he said last week that he won't decide his Dortmund future until after his summer holidays. He also added they he yearns to play in a league that is more physical, saying: 'How can I do my work when my opponent starts crying without contact?' Subotic has been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal, offering a possible alternative if Hummels doesn't want to make the move.

Runaway leaders in Sky Bet League One, they became the first team in the Football League to mathematically secure promotion on Tuesday night - and in sensational style. Hitting Bradford City for six of the best in their own backyard saw them triumphantly over the finishing line, although given their free-wheeling and free-scoring form the result really came as little surprise. Aden Flint celebrates with a bottle of Sky Bet champagne following Bristol City's promotion . City players are sprayed with champagne after securing promotion from League One . And there’s more. Add to that their memorable Johnstone’s Paint Trophy victory at Wembley last month - when Walsall were comfortably beaten 2-0 in the final - and you have a truly historic campaign for Steve Cotterill’s team. The season has been a personal triumph for tall, tattooed defender Aden Flint, who has played a central role in returning City to the Championship after two seasons away. His uncompromising defensive style has been combined with a knack of scoring from set-pieces, leading to 11 goals this season. Flint was on target at Wembley, fulfilling a childhood dream in the process, and also at Valley Parade on Tuesday. The Robins stars shower each other in their isotonic drinks following victory against Bradford City on Tuesday . Flint scores his side's fourth goal of the game as City earn an impressive 6-0 at Valley Parade . ‘When the players and the manager sat down at the start of the season, we had three aims,’ he tells Sportsmail. ‘The first was to win promotion back to the Championship, the second was to go up as champions and the third was to win the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. ‘We've managed to do two of the three and hopefully on Saturday we can achieve the other.’ That’s because City need another win to make absolutely sure they will be promoted as champions. The 25-year-old defender celebrates as the Robins earned promotion to the Championship in style . City manager Steve Cotterill celebrates promotion with a commemorative bottle of champagne . They currently lead Preston North End by 10 points but the Lancashire side have a game in hand and so three points are required against Coventry City at Ashton Gate this weekend. ‘Nobody wants that runners-up medal. The aim was always to go up as champions and we’re close to achieving that,’ Flint says. ‘We’ve had that winning habit and it’s a good one to get in to. We’ve been top of the league for most of the season and to drop down to second now would be disappointing.’ Seldom does one team dominate a division in this way. The lowest City have been placed is fifth and that was after their opening day fixture. The Robins have enjoyed a memorable season which has included lifting the Johnstone's Paint Trophy .

Flint wheels away in celebration after sending his side on their way to another memorable victory . Cotterill (left) and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas\\xa0look delighted as they celebrate with the trophy at Wembley . They kicked on from there and set a ferocious pace throughout the autumn. Since September 13th, there has only been one week when they haven’t been top of the pile and they have lost just three games in all competitions since the New Year. Not that success has been reserved for the league. They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, losing narrowly to Premier League West Ham, and claimed the Trophy too in front of over 40,000 of their fans at Wembley. Flint said: ‘I think any player dreams of scoring and winning at Wembley. There really isn't a better feeling in football. It is right up there with the highlights in my career but I would say that if we win on Saturday and go up as champions, that will push Wembley out.’ The defender’s goalscoring exploits have come as a surprise but he’s quick to credit his team-mates for the service: ‘I didn't expect to score as many as five to be honest! Flint holds the JPT with pride as he celebrates the 2-0 victory against Walsall last month . The defender was also named the Sky Bet League 1 Player of the Month for March . ‘I've just found myself in the right place at the right time to get on the end of all those set-pieces that have been delivered by the lads. ‘Aaron Wilbraham has bags of experience with him and has scored over 20 goals this season. Luke Freeman and Marlon Pack have been providing plenty of assists, not just for me but for everyone. ‘But everyone has chipped in, it has been a collective effort. The team spirit here has been the best I've ever experienced and it's been an enjoyable season.’ Promotion back to the Championship could be just the beginning of an exciting chapter in the club’s 118-year history.

Billionaire owner Steve Lansdown, who made his fortune in financial services, is funding a renovation of the club’s Ashton Gate home to expand the capacity to 27,000 and make it Premier League-ready. And, according to Flint, that’s precisely where the club is aiming: ‘We aim high and should be in the Championship, if not higher than that. ‘It's a massive city, I didn't realise how big it is until I moved here. It's surprising that the place hasn't got a Premier League team and maybe we can change that. ‘The chairman and the manager certainly have the ambition to achieve that. Seeing Bournemouth and Brentford doing so well in the Championship, nobody expected that and, who knows what will happen when we get there next season.’\",\n",

Denied a goal by Courtois' brilliance. 6.5 . Karl Henry - His defensive instincts were vital as QPR tried to stem Chelsea's attacking flow. 6.5 . Bobby Zamora - No wondergoal this week, but his experience was just as important in this west London derby. 6.5 . Charlie Austin - Caused Chelsea problems with his clever movement and went close on a couple of occasions. 6.5 . Subs . Niko Kranjcar 6 (for Sandro 81) Junior Hoilett 5.5 (for Zamora 83); Richard Dunne (for Isla 90) Chris Ramsey - 6.5 . Charlie Austin (left) nearly scored a spectacular effort in the first half but the Chelsea keeper denied him . Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois - The busier of the two keepers; produced a brilliant save in the second to deny Phillips. 7.5 . Branislav Ivanovic - Looked comfortable for much of the afternoon as opponent Henry showed little attacking intent. 6.5 . Gary Cahill - Stood up to the physical battle with Austin and Zamora with minimal fuss. 6.5 . The Belgian goalkeeper was Chelsea's stand-out performer with a number of crucial saves . John Terry - An unpopular figure at Loftus Road, but stood firm under hostilities from the home crowd. 7 . Cesar Azpilicueta - The left-back was kept busy by Phillips down QPR's right, but emerged with plenty credit. 7 . Ramires - Had little impact in midfield and was hauled off by Mourinho early in the second half. 5 . Nemanja Matic - Has had far better afternoons but, as ever, offered a solid-enough shield to his back-four. 6 . Cesar Azpilicueta (left) kept QPR's dangerous attackers quiet and was good going forward to join the attack . Cesc Fabregas - The masked midfielder was off-key all afternoon before popping up with the winner. 6.5 . Willian - Tireless as ever down both Chelsea flanks, but couldn't help his side break down resolute Rangers. 6.5 . Eden Hazard - A quieter than usual afternoon for the Belgian, but still provided a telling contribution for the winner. 6 . Didier Drogba - Handed a rare start with Remy and Costa missing through injury, but had little impact on proceedings. 6 . Subs: . Oscar 6 (for Ramires, 56); Juan Cuadrado 5.5 (for Willian 80); Kurt Zouma (for Fabregas) Jose Mourinho - 6.5 . Man of the Match: Courtois . Cesc Fabregas (right) slotted home the winner after good work from Eden Hazard and Oscar . Hazard (right) had a fairly quiet afternoon but provided the assist for Fabregas to win the clash .\",\n",

Brook, who defeated Jo Jo Dan to retain his IBF welterweight title last month, immediately challenged Khan in a post-fight interview but the Bolton-born boxer has instead agreed a bout on May 30, with his opponent yet to be confirmed. Khan has reiterated his intention to take on Brook within the next 12 months, although he insists that the undefeated 28-year-old only wants the fight because of the money it will earn him. Amir Khan (left), pictured during his last fight against Devon Alexander, has blasted Kell Brook's motives . Brook (right) shakes hands with British Superbike champion Shane Byrne at Donington Park on Tuesday . In an interview with iFL TV, Khan said: 'He's only faced one decent opponent in his whole career, so he has no room to talk. It seems to me that he's just calling me out for that one big payday. 'If he keeps going on like this, that one big payday fight for him will never happen because at the end of the day, he's just trying to win fans over by mentioning my name when he knows that I can't fight then because of Ramadan. 'And he's putting down my opponents, who are still better opponents than his opponents, like Jo Jo Dan, who should be called No No Dan, to be honest with you, because end of day, he's not done anything in his career.' Khan had announced a fight with Chris Algieri next month but he has now backtracked on that, claiming that there are 'some more options on the table'. Khan has now denied that he will face Chris Algieri next month, claiming there are 'some more options' Chris Algieri lost every round to Manny Pacquiao when he took on the Filipino star last November . Brook is desperate to fight Khan but his fellow Brit rejected the chance to face him at Wembley in June . A £5million clash with Brook at Wembley on June 13 was also an option but Khan rejected the offer as he will not fight during Ramadan because of his Islamic faith. He added: 'Like I said, this Algieri fight, if it happens, it's making me a lot of money; money that Kell Brook's not seen. That's why he's probably dying. Amir's making millions when he's not even seen his first million. 'There's classes in boxing. There's fighters in boxing who are the A-class fighters, the likes of Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather, who talk about and mention and say they know who Amir Khan is. 'When it comes to Kell Brook, who knows Kell Brook in America? Which fighter, apart from Shawn Porter, knows Kell Brook? Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao don't know who Kell Brook is, so I don't know what he's going on about trying to say he's a big name. 'Kell Brook's going on like he's the next guy to fight Mayweather when he's not even a big ticket seller. He might be big in his own backyard in Sheffield, but other than Sheffield, no-one knows him. Brook is hoping to fight Khan within the next 12 months as he looks to extend his unbeaten streak . Khan claims that Brook is not even a big name in the UK and is not able to face the world's biggest names . 'The way he's tried to come across to the US public is like he's a super-big name in the UK. He's not a big name in the UK.' And Khan insists that he is not avoiding Brook, even though the fight will be of greater benefit to the Sheffield-born star. 'Look, do I need the fight against Kell Brook?,' said Khan. 'I make a lot of money regardless if I fight Kell Brook. 'I will make a lot of money in this sport and I've made a lot of money in this sport of boxing. Kell Brook needs me to make that big money. 'Without me, he'll never make that big money unless he goes out and fights the top guys like Pacquiao, Mayweather, and Marquez, but I can't see him fighting those guys because he's always scared to get beat by them and lose his title.'\",\n",

After his strike against Rayo Vallecano, the Portuguese forward now has 300 goals for Los Blancos, despite having played in Madrid for only six seasons, amassing 288 appearances. He has well and truly made his name as a legend at the Santiago Bernabeu, only trailing Raul and Alfredo di Stefano in the club standings. Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 300 goals for Real Madrid in just six years with the La Liga giants . The Portuguese forward is catching Raul's (l) club record and is just seven goals shy of Alfredo di Stefano (r) Ronaldo heads home his 300th goal for the club - against Rayo Vallecano at the Vallecas Stadium in Madrid . 323 - Raul . 308 - Alfredo di Stefano . 300 - Cristiano Ronaldo . 289 - Carlos Santillana . 242 - Ferenc Puskas . Ronaldo has scored 206 with his right foot, 52 with his left, even managing 41 with his head. 46 of his goals at Real have been outside the box, many of them screamers. After claiming two FIFA Ballon d'Or awards during his time in Spain, as well as glory in La Liga and the Champions League, many would be running out of motivation, scratching around for more records to break. But Ronaldo, 30, doesn't only have the status of Raul or Di Stefano to look up to, but also Barcelona rival Lionel Messi, who is younger, and seemingly still improving. But there are other poachers that have formed their goalscoring reputation at one club, including a Portugal legend and an Everton hero who the former Manchester United man could draw inspiration from. Ronaldo celebrates after scoring his first goal (vs Deportivo in 2009, above), and his most recent (below) THE TOP 10 ONE-CLUB SCORERS OF ALL TIME . 10)\\xa0Dixie Dean, Everton (1925-37) 383 . Dean is the widely regarded as greatest player to have been born on Merseyside, and scored 60\\xa0goals in one league season in 1927/28. Impressed? He achieved that record after fracturing his skull and jaw in a motorcycling accident. Former Everton striker Dixie Dean is widely regarded as the greatest striker ever born on Merseyside . 9) Willy van der Kuijlen, PSV (1964-81) 394 . When his career started in Eindhoven, part of Der Kuijlen's motivation was to work at Phillips. He ended up with almost 400 goals, and was still only capped 22 times by the Dutch national side. Willy van der Kuijlen of PSV runs with the ball in the UEFA Cup match against Bastia in 1978 . 8) Lionel Messi, Barcelona (2004-present) 398* . Staggeringly, this Argentine forward is only 27. As the star of a mightily impressive Barelona team, expect Messi to climb up this list considerably over the next 10 years. Lionel Messi is closing in on the 400 mark with Barcelona and should rapidly rise up the scoring charts . 7) Zico, Flamengo (1971-83 and 1985-89) 401 . An attacking midfielder in the top 10? Often called the 'White Pele', Zico encapsulated a fine generation of Brazilian football, and impressed with his club side in his homeland. Over two spells with Flamengo, it's no wonder he was given a prestigious nickname. Zico of Flamengo takes on Liverpool's (l-r) Ray Kennedy, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen in a friendly . 6) Eusebio, Benfica (1960-75) 474 . Eusebio helped Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies, as well as four European Cup finals. Not just a poacher, Eusebio had it all and the Mozambique-born player was a Portuguese football legend. Eusebio lead Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies with a staggering amount of goals . 5) Uwe Seeler, Hamburg (1953-72) 507 . Up there with Gerd Muller and Franz Beckenbauer as a German great, Seeker was not a giant but a very strong player with fantastic shooting and heading abilities. His tally probably proves that. Uwe Seeler scored over 500 goals for Hamburg and is up there with Franz Beckenbauer as a German great . 4) Jimmy McGrory, Celtic (1922-37) 522 . Regarded as the Hoops' finest ever player, McGrory netted 55 hat-tricks for the club and went on to rewrite the football record books with his unbelievable scoring feats. 3) Josef Bican, Slavia Prague (1937-48) 534 . Slavia were one of the biggest clubs in the pre-war era, led by a striker from a poor family, brought up in Austria. He fled to Czechoslovakia during the second world war, and certainly made his mark. 2) Gerd Muller, Bayern Munich (1964-79) 573 . Muller scored an incredible 85 goals in a single season as Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title in 1972, and was the league's top scorer on seven occasions. Muller spent 13 campaigns with the Bavarian giants and with his goalscoring record, it's no wonder to see him near the top of the charts. Gerd Muller (centre) scored 85 goals in one league season with Bayern Munich and netted 573 in total . 1) Pele, Santos (1956-74) 1088 . Though his official record stands at 643 goals for Brazilian side Santos, and the 1088 includes strikes against a military XI, Pele tops the charts. Is he the best player of all-time, too? Pele unofficially scored 1088 goals for Santos and is widely regarded as the best player of all-time . PS... who are these Premier League sides' all-time top scorers? ARSENAL . 228 - Thierry Henry (1999-2007 and 2012) 185 - Ian Wright (1991-98) 178 - Cliff Bastin (1929-47) Thierry Henry enjoyed a prolific eight-year spell with Arsenal and is the club's all-time top goalscorer . CHELSEA . 211 - Frank Lampard (2001-14) 202 - Bobby Tambling (1959-70) 193 - Kerry Dixon (1983-92) EVERTON . 383 - Dixie Dean (1925-37) 159 - Graeme Sharp (1980-91) 138 - Bob Latchford (1974-81) LIVERPOOL . 346 - Ian Rush (1980-87 and 1988-96) 286 - Roger Hunt (1958-69) 241 - Gordon Hodgson (1925-36) Ian Rush netted 346 times over two spells with Liverpool and is streaks ahead of anyone else in the charts . MANCHESTER CITY . 178 - Eric Brook (1928-39) 166 - Tommy Johnson (1920-30) 153 - Colin Bell (1966-1979) MANCHESTER UNITED . 249 - Sir Bobby Charlton (1956-73) 237 - Denis Law (1962-73) 230* Wayne Rooney (2004-present) Wayne Rooney is just 19 goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton at Manchester United after his recent strike . NEWCASTLE . 206 - Alan Shearer (1996-2006) 200 - Jackie Milburn (1946-57) 153 - Len White (1953-62) Alan Shearer scored 206 goals for Newcastle, while Vic Watson managed 326 for West Ham United .

Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley . Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track . For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track . Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture.

The 2013 US Open champion ended the day on seven under, sharing third place and is one of a handful of players hanging on to the coat tails of runaway leader Jordan Spieth. But it took a neat bit of psychology to rescue his round after a disastrous start as he tried to build on his opening-day 67. Rose bogeyed three of the first four holes, finding himself playing from the trees as he recovered from wayward tee shots. And that was where the magic pencil line came to his rescue.

I made a great birdie at the 5th and that rallied me, and after that I played with the same rhythm as the first day.’ The dramatic transformation was then followed by a spectacular back nine with birdies at both par threes, putting tee shots to within a few feet of the hole both times. And 34-year-old Rose believes the change of fortune can continue into the weekend. He said: ‘I’m starting seven back and Jordan has played beautifully so far, but we all know a lot can happen. There’s magic out there on this course and it’s up to me to make something special happen.’ Maybe Ian Poulter could borrow Rose’s pencil after a disappointing day in which his putter couldn’t get going. He was par for the round after bogeying the 18th and sits at one over for the tournament. He said on Twitter: ‘Really disappointed. It’s simply unacceptable and disgraceful putting — 34 putts for level par is pathetic.’ Earlier, 19-year-old Scot Bradley Neil had a tough day, shooting a 79 and finishing 13 over. He has ben tipped for big things by Rory McILroy but admitted: ‘I’d prepared well for this, but it shows my game is not good enough yet,’ he admitted. ‘I need to work hard on it if I want to get back here.’',\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Arsenal moved further clear of the two Manchester clubs in second place, and kept the pressure up on leaders Chelsea, as they held on to beat a spirited Burnley at Turf Moor. Arsene Wenger's side were far from their best, but Aaron Ramsey's early goal put them ahead and Burnley, for all their endeavour, didn't create too many clear-cut chances. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Burnley . Tom Heaton: Saved well from Ozil in the build-up to Arsenal’s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear. 7 . Kieran Trippier: Forced Ospina into a good save with a curling free-kick and delivered well from corners. 6 . Jason Shackell: At fault for Arsenal’s opener as his sloppy pass gave possession away cheaply. 5.5 . Michael Duff: The 37-year-old did a good job of keeping Giroud under wraps and provided a threat from corners. 6.5 . Ben Mee: Made a superb block to deny Ramsey a second after a brilliant lobbed pass from Ozil. 7 . Ben Mee was booked in the first half for a blatant block on Aaron Ramsey, but responded well . Michael Duff goes up to challenge Arsenal's in-form striker Olivier Giroud during the hard-fought encounter . George Boyd: Full of running as ever but failed to trouble Arsenal when in possession of the ball. 6 . Scott Arfield: Another full of industry and almost provided an assist for Ings with a clever lob. 6 . David Jones: Brought calmness and quality to Burnley’s midfield but could not find a killer pass. 6.5 . Ashley Barnes: Wide left is not his favoured position but put Bellerin under pressure with and intense work ethic. 6 . Danny Ings: Starved action but went close with an acrobatic effort from Arfield’s chip into the box. 6 . Sam Vokes: Saw an early chance go begging when he fired at Ospina from close range. 6 . Subs: Taylor (for David Jones) 90 . George Boyd, who missed a great chance for Burnley on the half-volley, tackles Francis Coquelin . Scott Arfield tries to get to grips with Mesut Ozil as Burnley worked exceptionally hard against Arsenal . Arsenal . David Ospina: Was perhaps busier than he might have expected and had to make decent saves to deny Vokes and Trippier. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Faded after a bright start. Pinned back by Barnes’ aggressive closing down. Nutmegged by Mee. 6 . Laurent Koscielny: Kept a close eye on Danny Ings and restricted the Burnley top-scorer to just one chance. 7 . Per Mertesacker: Given a good, physical battle by Vokes and just about came out on top. 7 . Hector Bellerin is chopped down by Ashley Barnes as Burnley targeted the young Spanish full back . Laurent Koscielny suffered a few difficult moments as Arsenal sought to continue their excellent form . Nacho Monreal: Made a vital interception and clearance to thwart a chance for Ings. 6 . Francis Coquelin: Has developed into a key member of Arsenal’s midfield and did another fine job as the anchor man.7.5 . Mesut Ozil: Less effective than he was against Liverpool, with only flashes of brilliance. 6 . Aaron Ramsey: Applied the finishing touch after a goalmouth scramble to get the Gunners noses in front. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey fires home to put Arsenal ahead despite several Burnley defenders' best efforts . Santi Cazorla: Left his shooting boots in north London. The Spaniard whipped a free-kick narrowly wide and sent an ambitious left-foot volley over the bar. 6 . Alexis Sanchez: Saw plenty of the ball in the wide left channel but Burnley coped well to nullify the Chilean’s threat. 6 . Olivier Giroud: Marked out of the game by Burnley’s centre-backs and hardly had a kick before being replaced. 5 . Subs: Welbeck for Giroud (81), Chambers for Sanchez (90) Referee: Mike Dean 6.5 . Alexis Sanchez appeals for a free kick in a game where Burnley's tough tackling caused him some problems . Olivier Giroud holds the ball up, but couldn't add to his six-game goalscoring run at Turf Moor .\",\n",

On July 31 Nike, who employ Fred and a number of other workers at the Old Trafford shop, will see their agreement with the club expire. Some claim they are being kept in the dark over whether they will be re-employed, blaming the US sportswear giants for the issue. Manchester United mascot Fred the Red is among club megastore staff sweating over their jobs . A Manchester United fan wearing an Eric Cantona shirt outside the Old Trafford megastore on Sunday . However, Nike say they are in constant communication with the club and have entered into a consultation process with the staff.

They are all good people who work in there, and a lot of them don't make much more than the minimum wage, and they can do without this.

Fred the Red has been Manchester United's official mascot since 1994 and represents the club's nickname, The Red Devils. He wears the No 55 shirt and entertains the crowd at Old Trafford before matches. It could prove to be a shrewd move given that they will not have to pay royalties on any items sold within the facility, which is based the East Stand and attracts visitors from all over the globe. Most staff work in the store itself, although many work in the warehouse behind it. A Nike spokesman revealed that talks were ongoing but failed to give any assurances. 'Nike is in constant communication with Manchester United on the transition of the store management to the club,' they said. 'We are actively engaged in a consultation process with the store employees and have created an employee representation group for this specific purpose.' United will head to the US for a summer tour and are expected to have to wear their existing Nike kit. No agreement has been reached to end the deal early and manager Louis van Gaal is unlikely to want to see his side in action after August 1 - so close to the start of the new Premier League season on August 8.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Simon Mignolet insists Liverpool’s players are not feeling the pressure of trying to give Steven Gerrard a dream send-off – as their captain won’t let them entertain such talk. Victory over Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday enabled Brendan Rodgers’ squad to set up a date with Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final next Sunday and Liverpool are hot favourites to reach the final. The final, against either Arsenal or Reading, will be staged on May 30 – Gerrard’s 35th birthday – and has long been identified as being the perfect afternoon for Gerrard to bring the end down on his glittering Anfield career. Simon Mignolet (left) celebrates with Jordan Henderson after Liverpool reached the FA Cup semi-final . Philippe Coutinho (right) scored the winning goal in a tense 1-0 quarter-final victory against Blackburn . Captain Steven Gerrard, who is struggling to get in the side, will leave Anfield at the end of the season . It has created expectation and Liverpool have made heavy weather of getting to the semi-finals but Mignolet, who was outstanding in the 1-0 win at Ewood Park, maintains they are not thinking too far ahead. Gerrard, for one, won’t let them get carried away. ‘Nobody is talking about it,’ said Mignolet. Stevie is the first one to acknowledge that. Before we speak about the final, we have got to get through the semi-final and that is only possible after getting through here. ‘The only thing we can keep in mind now is how to get past Villa. Then we will see what comes. Villa will be tough. He is the first one to acknowledge that we can’t have any extra pressure on the team (to give him the dream send-off). He won’t let us think in a different way. Gerrard celebrates with Rafa Benitez after inspiring Liverpool to victory over West Ham in the 2006 Final . The Liverpool captain reacts after the Reds are beaten by Chelsea in the 2012 Final at Wembley . ‘We just want to focus on Villa and the games before that. We have got something to look forward to and we want to make sure that we get to the final. That is what we said in the dressing room before the game and everyone did their jobs.’ Liverpool last reached the FA Cup final in 2012, when they lost to Chelsea, and have not won the trophy since Gerrard inspired their 2006 victory over West Ham in Cardiff but they won’t let that opportunity distract their ambitions in the Barclays Premier League. Though they have had their ambitions of finishing in the top four dented by back-to-back defeats against Manchester United and Arsenal, the picture could change once more this weekend if United win the Manchester derby and Liverpool beat Newcastle on Monday. Liverpool have seen their form slip in the league with consecutive defeats to Man United and Arsenal (above) ‘We are pleased to get to the semi-final,’ said Mignolet. ‘Once it is semi-final time, we will make sure we are ready. But everything comes step by step. Newcastle is next. We are pleased with what we did against Blackburn but the next focus is the league. ‘We will be ready and focused then to make sure we get to the final. The only thing we can do is focus and keep our heads down. We have got to keep doing the things we are doing. There is still a lot to play for. The only thing that we can do is take every game as it comes. ‘When you are at Liverpool, you know you have to win every single game. After the results against Arsenal and Manchester United, we knew there was going to be criticism. You accept that. The only thing you can do is respond and we did that. Now the focus is on Newcastle. We will do our best to get three points.’',\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Tim Howard is adamant the Europa League is not to blame for Everton delivering what might be their worse season for nine years. Perhaps the goalkeeper would have been better off hiding behind conventional wisdom, considering the disappointment of this elongated campaign which could yet see Everton finish in the bottom half of the Premier League for the first time since 2006. Those prospects are dwindling, courtesy of a four-game unbeaten run, but there is no mistaking that Roberto Martinez’s side have fallen way below the standards set last season. The gap between their status now and after 32 games last season is 25 points, the difference between targeting a Champions League place and chasing the top 10. Tim Howard is adamant the Europa League is not to blame for Everton's poor season in the Premier League . The Merseyside outfit played 10 games in Europe this season before being knocked out by Dynamo Kiev . Aaron Lennon scored for Everton at Swansea City but the game ended in a 1-1 draw at the Liberty Stadium . Swansea City (4-3-3): Fabianski 6.5; Rangel 6, Fernandez 6, Williams 6, Taylor 6; Ki 6.5, Cork 6.5, Shelvey 7.5 (Dyer 83mins); Sigurdsson 6, Gomis 6 (Emnes 17, 6.5), Routledge 6.5. Subs not used: Amat, Britton, Grimes, Tremmel, Fulton. Booked: Taylor, Emnes, Williams. Everton (4-2-3-1): Howard 6.5; Coleman 6, Stones 6, Jagielka 6.5, Baines 6.5; McCarthy 6.5, Barry 7; Lennon 6.5, Barkley 5.5 (Mirallas 86), Osman 6 (Pienaar 28, 6); Kone 5 (Naismith 76). Subs not used: Robles, Besic, Garbutt, Alcaraz. Booked: Kone, Howard, Lennon. Man of the match: Jonjo Shelvey. Referee: Michael Oliver 5. Attendance: 20,468. The demands of playing 10 games in the Europa League have certainly taken their toll but Howard rejected that theory, saying: ‘That’s something that’s been talked about for the last five or 10 years but it’s just a blanket statement people make. Champions League teams have to do the same thing. ‘They play Wednesday and Saturday and it’s tough but no-one blames Champions League football. Every football team does not have a god given right to be anywhere. ‘We’ve put in honest performances but things just haven’t gone our way. We could sit here and make a list of a thousand different things but it’s not the Europa League or anything else.’ The perception that luck has not gone Everton’s way extended to Saturday when Aaron Lennon’s first-half strike was cancelled out by a Jonjo Shelvey penalty. Martinez was incensed by the award of a penalty though it appeared a reasonable decision. Neither side came out of the fixture unscathed, with Leon Osman of Everton and Swansea City’s Bafetimbi Gomis due to have scans today on respective groin and hamstring injuries. Howard will not allow Europe to be an excuse for what could be Everton's worst season in nine years . Jonjo Shelvey of Swansea scores past Howard with a penalty to level the scores on Saturday afternoon . Swansea manager Garry Monk confirmed a striker is top of his summer wishlist after being left with no fit front men, while Everton, in the shorter-term, have been told to finish in the top half. Howard added: ‘There’s a points total we want to achieve and get ourselves in the top half of the table.’ SUPER STAT: Everton named an unchanged team in the league for the first time since March 2014 against Fulham. Roberto Martinez will hope that after such a good campaign last time he does not get an unwanted record .\",\n",

No one is dead and buried and even Sunderland in 15th are a bad weekend away from falling into the relegation zone. It’s extremely close with the delightful benefit that there will be five key fixtures between sides in the bottom six. Have Hull got enough breathing room to survive what looks like the hardest run-in? Are Leicester too far back? Burnley have been dealt a reasonable hand but can they capitalise? Have QPR improved enough away from home to take any confidence to Leicester on the final day? Sportsmail considers the possibilities and delivers a verdict. Sunderland . Position: 15th on 29 points . Jermain Defoe (centre) reinvigorated Sunderland with a stunning strike to beat rivals Newcastle 1-0 . Dick Advocaat is overseeing Sunderland's survival bid as manager until the end of the season . Seven points split Sunderland in 15th and Leicester in 20th as the battle for Premier League survival heats up . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Crystal Palace (H) -D . Stoke (A) - D . Southampton (H) - L . Everton (A) - L . Leicester (H) - W . Arsenal (A) - L . Chelsea (A) L . Predicted total: 34 points . Verdict: Safe . Their derby win will have done them the world of good, as will the relative comfort of facing three teams in Palace, Stoke and Everton who have very little to play for. They need to make the most of those initial fixtures because it’s highly unlikely that they will get anything out of closing trips to Arsenal and Chelsea. Aston Villa . Position: 16th on 29 points . Christian Benteke scored a hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday . Tim Sherwood has helped Villa rediscover their scoring touch since replacing Paul Lambert as manager . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester City (A) - L . Everton (H) - D . West Ham (H) - W . Southampton (A) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Predicted total: 36 points . Verdict: Safe . At this stage of the season and in these circumstances you want winnable home games and that is what Villa have. However, with only three home wins this season (one less than on the road) they face a challenge. They ought to be OK, not least because a team that struggled to score under Paul Lambert has improved under Tim Sherwood. Hull . Position: 17th on 28 points . Steve Bruce's Hull  are placed perilously above the drop zone in 17th with seven games remaining . Ahmed Elmohamady will be a key man in Hull's bid to protect their position outside of the relegation zone . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Southampton (A) - L . Liverpool (H) - D . Crystal Palace (A) - D . Arsenal (H) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester United (H) - L . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Safe. On goal difference. The hardest run-in of the lot? It looks that way and therefore they could cut it awfully fine with regards to survival. There are two points between them and QPR at the moment, but Hull could have a potentially decisive advantage in the form of their goal difference, which is six better than QPR’s. Their fixtures are simply awful. Crystal Palace are isolated on that list as a team without major incentive. QPR . Position: 18th on 26 points . Charlie Austin has netted 17 goals in 29 games for QPR and will be vital during his team's difficult run-in . Chris Ramsey may find QPR's goal difference a big disadvantage, particularly with a tough final seven games . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Chelsea (H) - L . West Ham (H) - W . Liverpool (A) - L . Man City (A) - L . Newcastle (H) - W . Leicester (A) - D . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Relegated on goal difference . Three brutally hard fixtures with perhaps a mixed blessing that Liverpool and Manchester City – games you would expect them to lose anywhere – are played away. That places huge emphasis on home games against West Ham and Newcastle, neither of whom are in form nor have much to play for. It could all come down to the final game of the season, which is away at Leicester. Chris Ramsey has improved their away form but it is a big ask. Their poor goal difference in relation to Hull’s could be the deciding factor. Burnley . Position: 19th on 26 points . Danny Ings will spearhead Burnley's attack as they attempt to escape the Premier League relegation zone . Sean Dyche's side have two relegation crunch matches away from home against Hull and Villa . Predicted results: Six points from seven games . Arsenal (H) – L . Everton (A) - D . Leicester (H) – W . West Ham (A) - D . Hull (A) - L . Stoke (H) - D . Aston Villa (A) - L . Predicted total: 32 points . Verdict: Relegated . On paper they probably have the most straightforward opponents, but have the misfortune of playing two of their most critical fixtures – against Hull and Villa – away from Turf Moor. They have won only once away all season so it would be extremely ambitious to expect them to make hay now, considering four of those seven fixtures are on the road. Would expect their status to be decided by the final two games. Leicester . Position: 20th on 22 points . Esteban Cambiasso celebrates after an impressive display helped Leicester beat West Ham 2-1 on Saturday .

              " {'sequence': \"The Scottish Professional Football League has performed a U-turn by switching Rangers' final-day clash with Hearts back to Saturday, May 2. The league found itself at the centre of a furious row on Wednesday after announcing it had moved Gers' Tynecastle fixture with the Jambos to May 3 - 24 hours after their rivals for second place in the Scottish Championship, Hibernian, completed their campaign at Falkirk. The decision was made after TV broadcaster Sky decided to screen the match live but Hibs hit out at the change, claiming it would place the league's sporting integrity at risk as they jostled with Rangers for the play-off slots.

Zaliukas (left) jumps highest to score his side's equalising goal during the 1-1 draw with Livingston . The three other clubs involved have all backed the Easter Road club's stance - but the SPFL released a controversial statement on Wednesday night admitting it was puzzled by the fall-out. It said: 'It is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise'. But now it has been forced to backtrack after Sky gave the league the thumbs up to move the Rangers-Hearts clash at Tynecastle back to its original date. All other Championship fixtures will now be moved to 12.15pm to match the kick-off in Gorgie. Confirming the move, a league spokesperson said: 'Following consultation between the SPFL, member clubs and broadcast partners regarding the final round of Championship fixtures over the weekend of May 2 and 3, Sky Sports has now suggested an alternative schedule for its televised Championship match that weekend. 'As a result, we are pleased to confirm all five Championship matches that weekend will now kick-off simultaneously at 12.15pm on Saturday, May 2. The Hearts v Rangers match will be televised live on Sky Sports. 'The SPFL would like to thank Sky Sports for its flexibility and understanding and we're sure all football fans will look forward to an exciting climax to the Championship season.' Speaking before the switch, Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan admitted if he had been in charge, Rangers and Hibernian would have always kicked off at the same time. Easter Road chief executive Leeann Dempster feared the rescheduling would give the Ibrox side an advantage as they would know exactly what kind of result would be required to clinch the runners-up slot - saving them the bother of two extra games in the play-offs. Regan refused to directly criticise his SPFL counterpart Neil Doncaster for allowing the fixture change which has sparked the drama in the first place - but he did admit his personal preference would be to have all teams battling for vital play-off spots played at the same time. Rangers' Kenny Miller (right) tussles for the ball with Livingston's Declan\\xa0Gallacher (left) during the 1-1 draw . The SFA boss - who made his comments at the launch of the Football Memories project at Hampden - said: 'Sporting integrity is fundamental to any competition and I think that has to be considered in the round [of fixtures]. 'The clubs have made their feelings known and I'm sure Neil and his colleagues have listened to what their member clubs have said and come back with a pragmatic proposal. 'My preference in a play-off situation is having games finishing at the same time. 'It's not for me to stand here and criticise how another body has dealt with things. The clubs themselves have made their feelings known to the league. I know Neil and his colleagues have taken that on board and will do what they can to satisfy the various parties.' The row followed two days on intense negotiations with police and TV companies over the Premiership post-split fixtures and Regan added: 'Clearly the SPFL have come under pressure from a number of sources over the last 24/48 hours,' he said. 'But I'm sure Neil and his colleagues will be looking at the fall-out from the feedback they have received and trying to come up with a proposal. 'It's not helpful when you have negative issues being constantly played out in the press. When you get to the climax to the season, there is a lot at stake. 'It's never easy when you are trying to balance the needs of broadcasters, clubs, fans and sponsors but my view on this is that the fans come first and they have to be considered. I'm sure Neil will listen and come back with an appropriate and pragmatic solution.' Livingston's Scott Pittman (left) challenges Rangers' Dean Shiels (right) at the Energy Assets Arena .\",\n",

Sterling enraged Liverpool after saying in a BBC interview that he was ‘flattered’ to be linked with Arsenal. It is understood, however, that Arsenal have gone cold on Sterling, who scored in Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Newcastle on Monday. All talks about his future have been put on hold until the end of the campaign but Ian Ayre, Liverpool’s chief executive, issued a strong line yesterday, insisting that Sterling — who has turned down a contract in the region of £100,000 per week — would be at Anfield for a ‘long time’. Ayre said: ‘Raheem’s agent has asked that we park all discussions regarding his future until the summer. We respect that. Raheem is a Liverpool player and has two years left on his contract. We expect Raheem Sterling to be here for a long time.’ It appears that Sterling and Ibe have a shisha pipe apiece and are also drinking Fanta .

Stevens has yet to turn a wheel in anger for his new team in either qualifying or the race in the opening two Formula One events of the year in Australia and Malaysia. Manor have naturally had their teething problems since being rescued from administration, notably in Melbourne where Stevens and team-mate Roberto Merhi failed to make it out on track for a single lap due to the rebuild of their IT infrastructure. Manor driver Will Stevens is hoping to compete in the Chinese Grand Prix this weekend . At Sepang, after taking part in the two Friday practice sessions, Stevens frustratingly missed final practice and qualifying due to a fuel system issue. The 23-year-old, speaking ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix, said: 'Clearly Malaysia was a tough weekend for me. 'It started pretty well, I felt comfortable in the car straight away, and the pace we had in P1 and P2 would have got us easily inside 107 per cent for qualifying, so that was a positive. 'To then miss qualifying and the race was disappointing, but then we came into this year knowing the first few races would be difficult. 'I want to be out in quali and racing, and if I'm not then I'm going to be disappointed and frustrated because my job is to race.

But Louis van Gaal's side have hit form at the right time, while the current Premier League champions seem to have blown their chances of retaining their title after crushing defeats at Burnley and Crystal Palace. Since City beat United 1-0 last November, plenty of players have improved, some have faded, while both Van Gaal and Manuel Pellegrini have tinkered with their systems. Here, Sportsmail looks at how a composite XI of the sides might take shape, choosing the 4-2-3-1 formation both teams seem to favour. The Manchester United and Manchester City composite Xi ahead of the derby - selected by Sportsmail . Louis van Gaal (l) and Manuel Pellegrini's (r) sides are in contrasting form going into the Old Trafford clash . Goalkeeper - David de Gea . Just gets the gloves ahead of Joe Hart. A very close call, especially given the Englishman's form over recent weeks, but the athletic Spaniard edges it. David de Gea edges out Joe Hart for the goalkeeper slot and has been in fine form at Old Trafford this season . Right back - Pablo Zabaleta . Form has been patchy this term but is the best right back either club can boast. Manuel Pellegrini may opt for the more defensive Bacary Sagna, but he should not do so if only so we can see Zabaleta renew acquaintances with Marouane Fellaini, who elbowed him in the face last season. Pablo Zabaleta hasn't been at his best but is the best right back either club can boast at the moment . Centre back - Vincent Kompany . Like Zabaleta, not had the best of seasons but remains far above anything United currently have at centre-half. Should be coming into his best years but appears to be going backwards. That said, would be some dip in form to see him miss the cut. Vincent Kompany - pictured looking dejected after the defeat by Crrytal Palace - is still the No 1 choice . Centre back - Chris Smalling . Impressive in recent weeks before illness, keeping the likes of Harry Kane and Daniel Sturridge quiet. Deserves his chance to rectify his derby disaster, when he was red-carded at the Etihad in November. Chris Smalling was sent off in the last Manchester Derby in November and will be looking to make amends . Left Back - Gael Clichy . Both clubs may strengthen at left back in the summer although United will want more from Luke Shaw. Clichy has done well to keep out Aleksandar Kolarov for long periods and is a better left back than Daley Blind, despite the versatile Dutchman's sterling performances there recently. Both United and City will be looking to strengthen at left back this summer but for now Gael Clichy is best fit . Sport analysts BSports are predicting Manchester City are likely to win the derby at Old Trafford . Centre midfield - Michael Carrick . Finally getting the recognition he deserves outside of Old Trafford. At 33 he is excelling at the back of midfield in a quarterback role and has been at the heart of United's revival. Michael Carrick has been at the heart of Man United's revival - playing in a quarterback position in midfield . Centre midfield - Ander Herrera . United's man-of-the-moment finally appears to be on the right side of Van Gaal after a sluggish start. The box-to-box Spaniard is evidence of the Dutchman's claims that given time to adapt to his methods, his players will succeed. Ander Herrera is Louis van Gaal's man of the moment and seems to be flourishing in the manager's system . Attacking midfield - Juan Mata . March's player of the month is another to flourish after a sluggish opening. His two goals at Liverpool and understanding with Ander Herrera have helped United launch what looked for a long time like an unlikely assault on second place. Juan Mata has a fine understanding with Herrera and scored this stunning goal against Liverpool last month . Attacking midfield - David Silva . Arguably City's greatest player of all time, the nimble-footed magician drifts effortlessly into the side. Has remained superb despite the slump and continues to create chances for his suddenly-wasteful team-mates. David Silva has remained superb despite City's slum and continues to create chances for his team-mates . Attacking midfield - Wayne Rooney . The Scouser who loves the Manchester derby. Has scored 11 times against City and has more goals than anyone else in the long history of this fixture. Wayne Rooney has scored more goals than anyone in the Manchester Derby and is in good form up front . Striker - Sergio Aguero . Another underperformer who should be doing better for City, the Argentine has not scored in his last six matches. That said, few would bet against him ending that run on enemy territory. Sergio Aguero is another City underperformer but could end his six-game run without a goal against United . PLAYER TALLY . MANCHESTER UNITED - 6 . MANCHESTER CITY - 5 .\",\n",

Sunderland were the better team here. They were superior in terms of energy and creativity against a Newcastle side rather inexcusably playing — to use the term their manager hates — with their ‘flip-flops on’ once again. Nothing Dick Advocaat’s home team did, however, was anywhere near as exquisite as the goal that won this contest for them. It was a goal seemingly taken from another day and dropped haphazardly right into the middle of a match that didn’t really deserve it.

Jermain Defoe gave Sunderland a 1-0 lead with this brilliant volley - CLICK HERE to see more from our brilliant Match Zone service . Only seconds remained in the first half when Sunderland’s earnest but limited centre forward Steven Fletcher leapt to head a long pass from his own goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon towards Jermain Defoe. Still 25 yards out, the former England striker must have thought about bringing the ball under control. He had players arriving in support on either side. It would have been the sensible thing to do. True goalscorers have a mindset that is always switched to ‘glory’, though, and instead of taking the pragmatic route, Defoe decided to buy a ticket for the raffle. Moments after swinging his left foot at the ball he looked up to see it sail over Tim Krul in the Newcastle goal. All of a sudden, he was holding the winning ticket. On a weekend of sensational goals, this was another born of perfect technique, ambition and courage. It deserved to win a game that Sunderland deserved to win and it is up to the rest of Advocaat’s players to ensure it contributes to a run of results that keeps them in the Barclays Premier League.

Just what is it that eats the modern Newcastle? Dressed in grey, they didn’t even look like a Newcastle team. Did they play like one? Sadly, they did. Newcastle have been churning out rubbish like this for far too long now and it is depressing to report that it is becoming the norm. Sunderland were much improved, unrecognisable from the side who conceded four in the first half here against Aston Villa recently. That day, half of the Sunderland supporters were back in their cars by half-time. Here, under a new manager, Sunderland were comfortably better than local opposition who seem to head into derby games expecting to lose.

It was difficult to understand for long periods what Newcastle were actually trying to do. If they were trying to suffocate the game then for a while it worked. Once they got caught, though, they seemed to possess neither the wit nor the willpower to find a way back. Sunderland were not always convincing early on. They earned possession and territory off the back of hard work but didn’t do much with the ball. A Billy Jones cut-back from a corner to the far post was cut out by Jonas Gutierrez in the 10th minute,, while Jordi Gomez struck a low free-kick at Krul and Connor Wickham’s header was deflected wide by Moussa Sissoko, the Newcastle captain. Prior to the goal, however, Sunderland’s play in the final third had been rather unconvincing. Had Newcastle possessed any forward thrust at all, they might have found a way into the game. But once Defoe’s left foot brought the Stadium of Light to its feet, Sunderland rarely appeared in any danger. Another goal would have settled their nerves and they had opportunities. Indeed, they looked more dangerous in the second half. Former Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback (right) fouls Wickham during a ferocious second half display . Sammy Ameobi (right) is closed down by Sebastian Larsson and Billy Jones during the Premier League clash . Sunderland's Steven Fletcher (centre) is beaten in the air by Newcastle midfielder Jonas Gutierrez . Fletcher, though, has never been a goalscorer who has scored many goals — spot the contradiction? — and twice he failed here. A header on the hour needed more power to beat Krul and then another chance, provided by Defoe’s low cross, was spurned on the back of a decision to pivot away from goal and shoot on the turn rather than drive towards goal on his right side. We should not be too hard on Fletcher. He works as hard as any. The difference between a journeyman and an international of standing was evident, though, and Advocaat will be glad that predecessor Gus Poyet at least left him with a striker of pedigree before he was run out of town last month.Sebastian Larsson also failed in front of goal as the clock ticked on while, belatedly, Newcastle found a little something. Pantilimon was finally asked to work when Remy Cabella shot from 18 yards in the 78th minute before Ayoze Perez volleyed over from a corner at the death. That, in truth, was a real chance. A draw, though, would have been a joke. Newcastle manager John Carver admitted afterwards that his team had embarrassed him and it’s not the first time. When the final whistle blew, Defoe — substituted with 12 minutes left — wore a smile as wide as the river and with good reason.

The former Aston Villa frontman joined regular hosts Martin Roberts and Lucy Alexander for the popular property renovation series as he looked to help a brother and sister-in-law put some life into a three bedroom semi-detached house in Dartford. 'Great to be here. And as you know property can be incredibly rewarding but can throw up some unexpected surprises and we've seen many of those on Home under the Hammer,' said Dublin following his introduction. Dion Dublin made his Home Under The Hammer debut as a co-host on Monday morning . The former footballer seemed to be in his element as he discusses property renovation . Homes Under the Hammer airs weekdays on BBC1 at 10am. Hosts Lucy, Martin and Dion follow house buyers from the auction room, through the troublesome process of renovating the houses they have bought. The presenters meet the buyers and make suggestions on how best to improve the property. But, ultimately, let the buyers make their own decisions. Later, they return to the property to meet the buyers and find out how improvement works have progressed. Finally a selection of local estate agents visit the property, value it and the buyers discover if they have made themselves a profit. The 45-year-old certainly seemed to know his stuff as he pointed the way around the run-down property and was brimming with ideas for first-time property developers Mike and Lucia. 'The kitchen needs an overhaul. It's all a bit 80s and needs a refurbishment. 'You could knock through the dividing wall and give yourself a kitchen diner,' expressed the retired striker as he crouched down inside the lounge. 'You could even put this wall back in to give yourself a separate lounge and you could put a table and chairs in here. I can watch the football in here and be undisturbed.' Mike and Lucia bought the Dartford property at auction for £215,000 and gave themselves a budget of just £10,000 with an original plan to replace the windows and doors. Dublin talks with first time property developers Mike and Lucia, who had purchased the semi-detached house . A before shot of the three bedroom semi-detached house in Dartford . Mike and Lucia bought the property for £215,000 and hoped to sell it on for close to £270,000 . Unfortunately the semi-detached house needed more work than originally thought as Mike revealed the pair had to spend between £25,000 and £35,000 leaving them with a total spend of £245,000. 'Oh dear,' said Dublin, before claiming the pair had made the right decision and could be set for a profit of around £25,000 if the property is re-sold for it's new estimated value of between £260,000 and £280,000. Dublin - who has a long-held interest in the property market from his football career- received plenty of plaudits from viewers via social media including high praise from IBF World Super Bantamweight champion Carl Frampton. The 45-year-old was full of ideas when it came to how the property should be renovated . Dublin received plenty of plaudits from viewers via social media including high praise from Carl Frampton . He tweeted: 'Hold the phone! @DionDublinsDube is presenting Homes Under the Hammer!!! The best show on TV just got better'. Speaking ahead of his first appearance, the four-cap England international said: 'I am thrilled to be joining Martin and Lucy on Homes Under The Hammer. 'I have a passion for property and look forward to meeting people on the show who share that passion.' After retiring in May 2008, Dublin has gone on to forge a career in television and radio punditry as well as launching his own percussion instrument, 'The Dube'. Jo Street, Acting Controller of BBC Daytime, says: 'I am thrilled that Dion Dublin is joining the Homes Under The Hammer line-up.

              " {'sequence': 'The jury that sentenced Aaron Hernandez to life in prison on Wednesday want the world to know that they gave the ex-New England Patriots star a fair trial. The seven women and five men who voted to find the 25-year-old guilty of murder this week say it was a heart-wrenching decision, but one they made in confidence. On Thursday, the jury and alternate jurors say down with CNN\\'s Anderson Cooper to talk about the trial that has consumed their lives for the past three months. Scroll down for video . Decided: The jury that voted Wednesday to send former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez to prison for life sat down for a group interview on Thursday with CNN\\'s Anderson Cooper . Guilty: Hernandez was found guilty Wednesday of murdering Odin Lloyd in 2013. Pictured in court on Wednesday on the left, when the verdict was read. On the right, seen in a Patriots uniform before his arrest . When asked if they knew who Hernandez was before the trial started, most raised their hands.\\xa0However, they maintained that Hernandez\\'s notoriety didn\\'t have an impact on their decision. \\'It doesn\\'t matter how much money you have or how much money you make. We\\'re all people, and we\\'re all equal, and we all deserve the same fair trial, and that\\'s what we wanted to make sure we gave him,\\' juror Jon Carlson said. Only one juror, Rosalie Oliver, didn\\'t know of the tight end who had a $40million contract with the local NFL team. On the other side of the spectrum is juror Kelly Dorsey - a lifelong Patriots fan, who watches the team every Sunday during football season. While most of the group said that they had no interaction with Hernandez during the trial, Dorsey says she locked eyes with him on Wednesday as the verdict was being read. Familiar: When asked if they knew Hernandez before the trial, most of the jury raised their hands . Gripping moment: Jury member Kelly Dorsey says she locked eyes with Hernandez as the verdict was being read on Wednesday . \\'He was shaking his head and he mouthed something - and I didn\\'t know what he mouthed - but he was shaking his head just staring and I thought \\'You need to look back at the judge. Just look back at the judge.\"\\'\\' Dorsey recalled. Sentencing Hernandez was no easy decision to come to for the jury who heard from 130 witnesses and reviewed 400 pieces of evidence since the trial started at the end of January. The group deliberated for 35 hours over the course of a week, and decided that certain aspects of victim Odin Lloyd\\'s killing warranted a life in prison without the possibility of parole sentence - the highest sentence possible in the state of Massachusetts where the death penalty is outlawed. Many of the jurors pointed to the fact that Lloyd had been shot six times as evidence of the callousness of the crime. At the time of his death, Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez\\'s fianceé. \\'You shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times. There\\'s no need for that and there\\'s no need to use a gun. Period,\\' jury foreman Lesa Strachan said. Other jurors were shocked by Hernandez\\'s casual behavior, sunbathing with friends just a few hours after Lloyd is suspected to have been murdered. Directly after court on Wednesday, Hernandez was taken to a prison just two miles from Gillette Stadium, where he traded his  $1.3million mansion for a small cell and a pair of gray scrubs. The jurors will now be allowed to return to their day jobs, but they say the time they spent on the jury will stay with them forever. Oliver and other jurors say friends have been calling them up to congratulate them after the verdict - something that has left them speechless. \\'Who won? Odin Lloyd didn\\'t win. (His mother) didn\\'t bring back her son. Did Mr. Hernandez win? No, because he\\'s going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he\\'s 25 years old. The worst part for me is: How about that little girl that\\'s never going to see her father again?\\' Oliver said.',\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Lewis Hamilton is getting inside teammate Nico Rosberg’s head as the German bids to win his first World Championship title, according to two time winner Mika Hakkinen. Rosberg accused Mercedes team-mate Hamilton of deliberately compromising his race at last weekend’s Chinese Grand Prix by slowing down but Mika Hakkinen said the British driver’s tactics, which saw him win a third consecutive Grand Prix ahead of the German, were entirely legitimate. ‘If you are leading a race that's a fantastic place to be and what goes in your mind when you are leading into finish the race first,’ said Hakkinen. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Nico Rosberg appears less pleased with 2nd . Rosberg accused Hamilton of being selfish by driving too slow and compromising his second position . Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . ‘So you do everything with the team in the right way so you are able to finish the race first.\\xa0If you have to save tyres, brakes, engine, gearbox whatever it is, that's what you do. 'You don't think about the guy behind you, what he is feeling, how his car is handling or how you want his car to handle at the end of the race you just take care of your own stuff. ‘I have been in this situation with Michael [Schumacher] where where I was much quicker than him and he was definitely challenging me in a very interesting way,’ added Hakkinen. ‘What Lewis and Nico are going through at the moment, they are having a very difficult challenge, already last year and there are challenges continuing this year between them. Rosberg responded to a fan who accused him of 'crying' after he complained about Hamilton . Former world champion Mika Hakkinen says Hamilton was well within his rights to look after himself . Hamilton celebrates with with his trophy and bottle of champagne after his race win . 'They are the drivers with the best possible chance of winning at the moment. It requires a lot of nerves from the drivers to be able to be a good racing driver and not to start fighting because it doesn't make any difference.’ Hamilton, who is bidding to win a third World Championship title this season, has out-qualified and out-raced Rosberg in all three grand prix and Rosberg will likely be feeling the pressure according to Hakkinen. ‘Nico has definitely got big pressure on him,’ said Hakkinen, ‘He doesn't know how it feels to be a world champion and doesn't know what confidence a world championship generates inside you when you are racing driver. ‘He is still hunting that feeling. He wants to win but first he has to beat Lewis but Nico is a great driver and if you look at the qualifying result at the last grand prix the time difference was hardly nothing. I don't say that pole position is the key point to win a grand prix certainly it helps to start in pole.’ Lewis, many congratulations. Was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from Ferrari and, also, can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up? Were you aware that Nico was getting so backed-up towards Sebastian Vettel? LH: I wasn’t controlling his race, I was controlling my own race but, great race, I’m really happy. Definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the Ferraris were very, very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres. So, today the real goal was to manage the tyres. And, as I said, my goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico through the whole race. So, I just managed it and got to really enjoy it, to be honest. A few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop, which I really enjoyed. Ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole, full practice sessions, on my side of the garage at least. And it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race. So really happy, and yeah, kinda excited. Q: Nico, can you talk us through your view of the race today. Started second, finished second but you sounded at times as though you felt at times under a little bit of unnecessary pressure maybe? NR: No. It’s just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race. Driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that Sebastian was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me. And then I had to cover him. So, first of all it was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because I had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer. So I’m unhappy about that, of course, today. Other than that, not much to say. Q: Lewis, would you like to respond? LH: Not really! My job is not to… it’s not my job to look after Nico’s race. My job’s to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible – and that’s what I did. I didn’t do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up. I just was focussing on myself. If Nico wanted to get by he could have tried but he didn’t.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Leigh Griffiths sure knows how to finish. And, in passing, how to make a point. Left on the bench for Wednesday night’s home clash with Kilmarnock, perhaps uncertain over his place in the starting XI for Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness, the Celtic striker scored a 19-minute hat-trick to guide his team to a handsome 4-1 victory. The Treble-chasing reigning champions came from a goal down, inspired by Kris Commons and the second-half introduction of Griffiths, to record a win that takes them eight points clear at the top of the Premiership – and lifts confidence ahead of their trip to Hampden. Hat-trick hero Leigh Griffiths with signed match ball and man of the match award . Darryl Westlake’s wickedly deflected strike early in the second half had given the visitors a shock lead completely against the run of play – only for Commons to equalise in spectacular, if contested, fashion eight minutes later. As good and important as Commons was for Celtic, though, even his performance was overshadowed by the arrival of Griffiths, who simply exploded on to the scene with three goals of supreme quality in less time than it takes for the average warm down. Rightly named Man of the Match despite playing for just over half an hour, the former Hibs front man eased all the frets and fears of home fans on a night that had looked to be slipping away from their team. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths (right) completes his hat-trick against\\xa0Kilmarnock . Celtic had begun the night with a starting XI looking very much like the team Deila might have been thinking about for Hampden, all things being equal; leaving Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven, both suspended for the semi-final, on the bench suggested that he was giving his Cup formation a gentle run out. Against a Kilmarnock team whose ambition rarely threatened to over-reach their ability, there were certainly passages of play that resembled nothing so uncompetitive as a training session. With Lee Miller plodding along on his lonesome up front and only the pace of left winger Tope Obadeyi carrying even the hint of a threat to the home side, the visitors – doughty in defence but reliably clumsy on the ball – were obviously intent on playing a containing game. Griffiths collects the match ball after his second-half hat trick on Wednesday night . Maybe, just maybe, they’d catch Celtic sleeping and grab a surprise goal. And, if not, well, a nil-nil at Parkhead is never a disgrace, right? The problem for those who turned up in anticipation of a football match was that, however well Celtic played, attack against defence boasts only so much in the way of entertainment value. James Forrest looked the most obvious outlet for a Celtic breakthrough, the winger scampering down the left and finding space where none should have existed, though too often making the wrong call. The former Scotland regular might have scored himself with seven minutes on the clock, tearing into the box and receiving an Emilio Izaguirre pass at pace, yet Forrest’s first touch was half an ounce heavy – allowing young Killie captain Lee Ashcroft to make a vital block on his shot. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half . It didn’t take overly long for the crowd, such as it was on a night when empty seats abounded, to grow frustrated by the home team’s inability to get themselves ahead. Virgil van Dijk loping forward from central defence caused a few stirs of excitement, Stefan Johansen’s running beyond lone striker John Guidetti promised at least a possibility or two. Still space in the final third remained at a premium. Home skipper Scott Brown should have done a great deal better with an Izaguirre cut-back on the half-hour mark, failing to connect cleanly with the bouncing ball and watching it balloon high and wide of the target. Would set-pieces, of which there were an increasing number, provide a more productive avenue of attack for Celtic? Well, big Van Dijk came fairly close with a flashing header from a Commons corner. In open play, an inability – or unwillingness – to let fly continued to be the running theme, one great guddle involving Guidetti and Forrest, neither finding that half yard needed to take a shot inside the box, moving the locals to howls of annoyance. If they were irked by their heroes showing less than perfect concentration in the art of opening up their opposition, Kilmarnock’s opener had the home support in uproar when they took a hugely unexpected lead four minutes into the second half. Celtic manager Ronny Deila (left) congratulates Griffiths after the final whistle . Two or three Celtic players had a chance to close down and dispossess Obadeyi as he made ground and tied defenders in on the flank, yet he kept hold of the ball long enough for support to arrive in the shape of Westlake. Sure, the midfielder’s shot took the kind of deflection for which there is no accounting, smacking Jason Denayer and spinning beyond a helpless Craig Gordon. But failure to apply due diligence at the back definitely contributed to the concession. Their fans roused and their own pride hurt, Celtic had to muster a quick response. Step forward the captain, who pounced to nick the ball off the toe of Sammy Clingan – prompting immediately complaints of a dangerous challenge. Griffiths was thrown into the fray before the game could be restarted, Forrest making way as Celtic tried to provide Guidetti with more support up front. As substitutions go, not one of Deila’s worst. Griffiths had been on the park all of six minutes, in fact, when he put Celtic ahead, rising to score with a downward header after Commons had shown excellent skill and vision to drive towards the byeline, beat his man and dig out a cross to the back post. As soon as they went ahead, the shackles seemed to fall from the limbs of the home players. Suddenly, they were finding space, making killer passes, creating openings and – most importantly – taking shots. None better than the 25-yarder that Griffiths sent screaming past Craig Samson with 10 minutes remaining, the ball cannoning in off the keeper’s right-hand post. When he was put through behind the defence four minutes later, there was never any doubt about what would happen, the striker finishing low and hard past a shell-shocked Samson.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Winger Dom Manfredi stole the limelight from Ben Flower and Sam Tomkins as Wigan thrilled a 14,175 crowd at the DW Stadium with an exciting 30-20 win over Warrington. Most eyes before kick-off were on Welsh international Flower as he prepared to make his return from a six-month suspension imposed for punching Lance Hohaia in October's Grand Final defeat by St Helens. And the Wigan fans were delighted at half-time when the club announced the re-signing of Tomkins on a four-year deal from New Zealand Warriors, starting next season. Wigan winger Dom Manfredi scored a hat-trick for the second time in five days . All eyes were on Ben Flower on Thursday night as he made his return from a six-month ban after being sent off for punching Lance Hohaia in the opening moments of Wigan's Grand Final defeat by St Helens last October. RECEPTION: Flower's name was greeted with huge cheers when the team announcement was made 10 minutes before kick-off and there was a deafening roar 23 minutes into the match when he made his entrance, with Wigan fans on their feet for a standing ovation. PERFORMANCE: The Welshman came up with a knock-on four minutes into his return and clearly looked rusty after his lengthy lay-off. He produced some strong charges, however, and did his fair share of tackling before taking a breather after 32 minutes. Flower later returned for the last four minutes, by which time his side were firmly in charge. OVERALL: A steady if unspectacular return for the former Crusaders front rower in a match dominated by the tryscoring prowess of his young outside back team-mates. Unsurprisingly rusty at times, he will be better for his 36-minute contribution, made in two spells. By the end of a pulsating derby, however, it was the name of 21-year-old Manfredi which was on most people's lips after he scored a second hat-trick in five days. Manfredi had touched down three times in Wigan's 34-0 win over Catalans Dragons on Sunday and he once more demonstrated his exceptional ability to finish off the Wolves after they had taken the lead for a third time early in the second half. Warrington could hardly have made a better start, scoring two tries inside the first 10 minutes as they monopolised the early play. Skipper Joel Monaghan had gone close in the opening moments after gathering Richie Myler's high kick to the corner and he enjoyed an unopposed run-in after taking Stefan Ratchford's cut-out pass to open the scoring. Ratchford added the touchline conversion and the visitors increased their lead when Chris Bridge went through the attempted tackle of his opposite number Dan Sarginson for the first of his two tries. Wigan barely had touched the ball at that stage but they quickly demonstrated their attacking flair with two superbly-crafted touchdowns. Stand-off George Williams came up with a break for the first but it was a magnificent final pass from winger Joe Burgess that enabled England second rower Liam Farrell to finish off the move . Ben Flower (centre) returned to action after serving six-month ban for punching Lance Hohaia . Moments later Sydney-bound Burgess was again the provider as full-back Ryan Hampshire, making amends for the first of two bad handling errors, went over for the Warriors' second try, with Matty Smith's second goal edging his side in front. That was the signal for Wigan coach Shaun Wane to reintroduce Flower but there was little scope for the forwards to get into the action as the outside backs continued to dominate. The lead changed hands twice more before half-time, with Bridge going through Sarginson for his second try - only for Manfredi to cancel it out by taking advantage of some outrageous offloads from Anthony Gelling and Joel Tomkins to score his first. Forward Flower enjoyed a low key return as the Wigan backs ran Warrington ragged in the second half . Leading 16-14 at the break, the highly-impressive Gelling twice took the wrong option as Wigan were the first to attack in the second half and the misses began to look costly when when Warrington second rower Ben Currie sliced through the home defence for his side's fourth try to put them back in front. Wigan were not to be denied, however, and Manfredi went over twice in eight minutes to complete his hat-trick and apply the finishing touches to a splendid victory. The hosts produced some quick hands to get him over on 61 minutes but it needed a huge slice of good fortune for him to complete his hat-trick, with Smith's drop-goal attempt charged down and falling nicely for the big winger after Gelling had instinctively put his boot to the loose ball.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"If Andrew Strauss becomes England’s new supremo, the comeback hopes of Kevin Pietersen, which gained momentum with the sacking of Paul Downton, would come to an abrupt halt. Strauss said on Saturday that he can see no way back for the man he fell out with so badly over the messages Pietersen sent to South African opponents apparently criticising him as captain three years ago. Pietersen begins his county comeback with Surrey against Oxford University in The Parks on Sunday having been encouraged to return to the domestic game by ECB chairman-elect Colin Graves and emboldened by the demise of Downton, the man who sacked him last year. Andrew Strauss (right) says the Kevin Pietersen affair is a 'distraction' for English cricket . Strauss and Pietersen pictured during happier times during the 2011 series with India . Yet his hopes of an England return would seem over if Strauss succeeds in becoming the new England director of cricket after throwing his hat into the ring on Friday. ‘It’s very important for English cricket to move on from the Kevin Pietersen situation,’ said Strauss, who infamously called Pietersen ‘a complete c***’ on air last season when he thought his microphone had been switched off. ‘That threatens to envelop everything at the moment. The story has become more of a distraction than him actually playing. It’s become that big. The ECB and the England team’s efforts to move on from him haven’t worked so far but by winning that will allow them to move forward.’ Strauss’s views are as much from a cricketing point of view as a personal one, even though his feelings towards Pietersen clearly have not changed. ‘If you look at it from pure cricketing logic, after the Ashes is over, it’s quite hard to see a situation where Kevin Pietersen would come back into the side,’ Strauss told Wisden editor and Sportsmail cricket writer Lawrence Booth on the Lord’s podcast. ‘You’re building towards the next Ashes in two and a half years time and the World Cup in 2019. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey for the county season in an attempt to regain his England place . Pietersen's chances of a recall have been boosted by the likely appointment of Michael Vaughan in the new ECB director of cricket role created following the sacking of Paul Downton as managing director . ‘I think if you were to bring Kevin Pietersen back it would be a short-term measure to help you win the Ashes but I can’t see that happening personally because there are too many bridges to build in too short a period of time. I think after the Ashes the story does move forward at that point.’ Michael Vaughan remains favourite to pip Strauss for a role that would have powers not enjoyed by anyone in English cricket since Ray Illingworth in the Nineties. Graves and new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison want to overhaul the system and make the new man more the equivalent of a football manager than a managing director, as was Downton. That means the director of cricket will probably be a hands-on presence in the dressing room with overall responsibility for coaching and selection, with the panel of selectors almost certainly being disbanded. There were key figures who wanted Strauss to take the job when Hugh Morris stood down 18 months ago, not least the Welshman himself, but at that stage Strauss felt it was too early for him and he has dabbled in commentary while not being a natural at it like Nasser Hussain and Atherton. Pietersen and Vaughan pictured together on England duty at Lord's in 2008 . Strauss, who played in 82 Tests with Pietersen, believes his recall would only be a short-term measure . Now the new regime at the ECB have moved the goalposts and the man Graves and Harrison want is clearly Vaughan, if they can persuade him to give up his extensive lucrative media work and other cricketing interests. Vaughan is here to commentate on England’s three-Test series against West Indies for Test Match Special and intriguingly is staying at the same hotel as the team. It will be fascinating to see whether he changes a hard-hitting commentary style that has seen him criticise several of the players who he may well now take charge of, with the ECB looking to make a quick appointment. Vaughan will need to build some bridges himself with a number of England players if he takes over but clearly Graves is not concerned by what has happened in the past and feels his fellow Yorkshireman is perfect for the role. Jimmy Anderson, who will be playing his 100th Test needing four wickets to become England’s leading wicket-taker, did not want to get drawn into which of his former England captains should get the big job. England bowler Jimmy Anderson refused to be drawn on who he would prefer to take up the role . ‘I don’t really have an opinion because we’re concentrating on building up to a Test,’ said Anderson. ‘That’s for the two new guys in charge. They’ve obviously got a clear plan of where they want to take English cricket and I’m sure they’ll get the right man for the job.’ Even though it was a diplomatic answer it was perhaps revealing that Anderson then named Hussain and Strauss as the best captains he has worked under, a view that was consistent with his autobiography where he offered little praise to the 2005 Ashes-winning captain Vaughan. Clearly, Peter Moores and even Alastair Cook will be almost auditioning for Vaughan in this series and it is impossible to see Moores in particular carrying on as coach alongside a man in Vaughan who has been so critical of him. The distractions that Strauss talked about, not just those provided by Pietersen, clearly still loom large over an England team who, it should be remembered, won the last three Tests they have played. It is imperative, not least for their captain and coach, that they continue that run here.\",\n",

Former England and Manchester United midfielder Paul was in the stands as the on-loan Hull player scored two long-range efforts for the visitors, one in each half. Play-off chasing Derby were 1-0 up, 3-1 down and 4-3 behind in an amazing game which also saw Huddersfield have three goals ruled out. Tom Ince (centre) is currently on loan at Derby from Premier League side Hull City and has been in fine form .

Booked: Dawkins . Scorers: Ince 16, 79, Dawkins 52, Lingard 61 . Referee: Dean Whitestone . Attendance: 15,889 . Ince crashed home a stunning 25-yard drive on 16 minutes seconds after seeing a free-kick from similar distance saved. Derby lost Craig Bryson to injury early on and then Zak Whitbread also went off on 27 minutes. After that Huddersfield, seeking back-to-back home wins against play-off contenders after beating Ipswich last time out, stepped up a gear. Nahki Wells and Ishmael Miller went close before three goals in seven minutes left Derby shell-shocked. There was controversy about Huddersfield's first on 38 minutes when Oscar Gobern appeared to handle Conor Coady's ball into the box. Everybody except Gobern seemed to stop for a flag or whistle but neither came and he hooked in from close range. Gobern, out of contract at the end of the season, last scored for Huddersfield in January 2012. A Mark Hudson header from a Reece James corner deflected into the net off a Derby defender on 41 minutes. Reece James, on-loan from Manchester United, then scored his first goal for the Terriers straight from a corner. He whipped in an effort from the right in first-half injury time and it went in after Derby keeper Lee Grant came for but missed the ball. Derby came out for the second half on fire and were quickly level when first Simon Dawkins and then Jesse Lingard scored. Substitute Dawkins fired in from a Stephen Warnock cross on 52 minutes while Lingard struck from outside the box after Dawkins initially tried to shoot. Midfielder Lingard, like James, is on loan from Manchester United but unlike the Town man has just signed new a two-year contract at Old Trafford. Huddersfield, pegged back at 3-3, would not give up and were in front again when Wells had a shot deflected in. He had already had a goal ruled on 57 minutes when he followed up with an effort off which looped into the net off a Derby defender after Ishmael Miller was denied. It was end-to-end action and Ince scored his second - again from distance - after good work by Darren Bent to make it 4-4 on 79 minutes. Miller had two goals ruled out, one for a foul on Grant and the other, in stoppage time, for offside. Also in injury time Hudson headed wide from a Jacob Butterfield cross while Johnny Russell nearly had the last word with a free-kick which just went over. A point will help cement Derby's play-off position. Huddersfield, who are already safe, are now unbeaten in five matches.\",\n",

Whatever the detail of the conversation, and however lasting the effects may be, the short-term impact on the 24-year-old force of nature — often as unruly and unpredictable as a whirlwind — has been nothing short of remarkable. As the kid himself puts it: ‘Being top scorer now means that, since I have had a talk with the manager, I have knuckled down and proved him wrong, proved JC wrong and shown that I deserve to be here.’ Hat-trick hero Leigh Griffiths with signed match ball and man of the match award . Rather revealing, isn’t it? Clearly demanding Deila and original gym rat Collins did not hold back in dealing with the gifted but wild natural talent, wielding a big stick in a bid to persuade Griffiths that the carrot wasn’t such a bad alternative to chips and tea cakes. ‘I had to improve,’ admits the former Hibs star. ‘I wasn’t playing at the start of the season. I had a talk with the manager and John Collins about everything and about what they wanted me to do. ‘Thankfully, in the two months since the turn of the year, I have knuckled down and they are seeing the rewards now. ‘What did they say to me? I had to be working hard in the gym and working hard to get my fitness levels up. I did that and I have been bang on form since the turn of the year. ‘When I was at Hibs, I would have been the first name on the team sheet given the goals I scored. ‘But coming here, it’s a massive club and, with the new manager coming into the club, he wanted to impose his own philosophy. ‘Playing one up front, you have to work hard and my fitness levels were not up to his standards. Since January, though, my fitness levels have been good and I have been scoring goals. ‘I was brought to Celtic to score goals and I’ve started to do that since the turn of the year. I haven’t set any new targets — but I do want a good run of games. ‘I want to be starting every game from now until the end of the season and score as many goals as I possibly can.

His second treble haul in Celtic colours took his total for the season to 15 goals, the majority of those coming in 2015, as he has contended more frequently with John Guidetti, Stefan Scepovic and Anthony Stokes for the lone striker’s role favoured — for now, at least — by Deila. Watching Guidetti amble around aimlessly until Griffiths arrived to partner the big Swede on Wednesday night, it definitely seems as though Deila has only two options for Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness. Either he plays both in a traditional front-pairing. Or he lets Griffiths, scorer of an early opener against Caley Thistle in the Highlands last weekend, loose on his own at Hampden. If his midweek goals explosion makes it impossible to omit the former Livingston, Dundee and Wolves striker from the starting XI, his record in major semi-finals at the national stadium also counts in his favour. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half . The extra-time hero as he scored his second of the game to ease Hibs past Falkirk 4-3 at this stage of the Scottish Cup two years ago, Griffiths also opened the scoring for Celtic against Rangers in the League Cup semi earlier this season. ‘I’ve played in two semi-finals at Hampden and I have won two,’ he points out. ‘Hopefully, I can continue that. ‘I’ll be looking to score again. But the most important thing is for the team to win the game and reach the Scottish Cup Final. ‘Inverness will come down and make it difficult for us. They proved last weekend they are a hard team to beat. ‘Every game against them this season has been tight and I expect the same again on Sunday.’ If Griffiths starts and plays as he did against Killie, even Caley Thistle at their most obdurate will struggle to cope. His hat-trick — one perfectly placed header, one absolute screamer from distance and a driven low finish — was a timely reminder of what he can do, when the mood is upon him. Celtic manager Ronny Deila (left) congratulates Griffiths after the final whistle . ‘It wasn’t a bad night’s work,’ he says with a smile. ‘It was just good to get the win because we were disappointed not to win at Inverness last weekend. And we had suffered a setback, going 1-0 down to Kilmarnock, although the boys fought back in the right way. ‘All of the goals were my favourites. The first one was a great ball into the box by Kris Commons and I managed to head it down into the net. ‘The second one went in off the post and I was just waiting for the whistle to go for being offside for the third. Thankfully, it didn’t come and I fired it back across the goalkeeper. ‘It’s only my third hat-trick in senior football, so it’s decent. My second one came for Celtic against Inverness last year.’ Cute move, dropping that into conversation. Take note, gaffer? Not only am I bang in form, not only do I have a great record at Hampden, but I’ve shown I can do the business against Inverness. Celtic start as favourites on Sunday and, with Hibs also edging the odds in their semi against Falkirk, Griffiths could spend May 30 torn between professional pride and genuine love for his hometown team. Asked outright if he would like to face Hibernian, balancing up the desire to become a Treble winner against the need to condemn his boyhood heroes to at least one more year of Scottish Cup taunts, Griffiths admitted: ‘Honest answer, no! ‘If they get there, it will be great for the club, but I’m just concentrating on doing my job for Celtic. We are eight points clear in the league and in a good position and, obviously, we want to go for the Treble. ‘There is still a long way to go and we have difficult games coming up. At the moment, Inverness are standing in our way of having a potentially great season.’\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Ronny Deila hailed ultimate impact sub Leigh Griffiths for his hat-trick performance in Celtic’s comeback Premiership win over Kilmarnock. And then Parkhead manager said the striker’s desire to prove him wrong should serve as an example to any player left out of his starting XI. Griffiths took just 19 minutes to score a treble that takes Celtic ever closer to a clean sweep of domestic honours, staking an obvious claim to start in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness at Hampden. Deila, asked if he thought the forward was trying to prove a point, said: ‘It looks like that - and that’s how you’re going to do it. That’s what I expect from the other subs as well. You can be angry but the way to get back into the team is to prove you deserve to play - like Leigh did today. Ronny Deila celebrates after Celtic came from behind to beat Kilmarnock at Parkhead on Wednesday . ‘He was fabulous. You can’t do any better than three goals. His contribution was excellent. And his left foot? He could be a kicker in American football – he’d be very good, I think. ‘He’s improved a lot in my time here. He’s training well and as a 24-hour athlete he’s been getting better and better, even though he eats cakes on the bench sometimes. But it’s just a start – he needs to keep working on small things and he’ll get even more goals. ‘He and John Guidetti played well together today and that’s something to think about when we play with two strikers.’ Asked if Griffiths is now a certain starter for Sunday, Deila said: ‘He played very well today so we’ll see.’ Deila shakes hands with Leigh Griffiths, who collects the match ball after his hat-trick . Celtic came back from the loss of a goal early in the second half to crush Killie, Deila saying: ‘Defensively we were very good for the first 60 minutes, we had the ball all the time and they didn’t have a shot on target. ‘Our attacking play was too slow, too many square passes and we didn’t create anything. We said at the break we needed to take more risk and get behind them. With Leigh coming on we had a lot more movement and we opened them up and got our goals.’ Celtic could now win the title against closest rivals Aberdeen on May 10 – if both teams win all their games beforehand. But Deila hopes his team won’t even need to beat the Dons in their own back yard to be crowned champions. Griffiths completes his hat-trick against\\xa0Kilmarnock on Wednesday at Parkhead to move eight points clear . Wednesday’s win took Celtic eight points clear with six games remaining. Should both teams win their remaining league games, an away win at Pittodrie would finish the race. Yet Deila said: ‘We could win it before Pittodrie. Hopefully we will. It’s possible – if they lose a game and we win we can do that. ‘We want to win the title as early as possible and today was a very important win and we’re in to a very important week. If you can get into the last five games eight points ahead we have a very good chance. ‘ . The Parkhead side have two Friday night fixtures against Dundee and St Johnstone – and won’t play another game on Saturday at 3pm this season. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half . If Celtic wrap up the league flag they will be presented with the trophy before their final home game against Inverness Caledonian Thistle on May 24, the final day of the season. Aberdeen will play St Johnstone in their final game, with the top six completed by a Dundee derby. The final round of bottom six ties could be held on the night of Friday, May 22. The team which finishes 11th will be consigned to a two-leg play-off against the winners of the Championship play-off. With St Mirren 10 points adrift at the foot of the table with just 15 points left to play for, Motherwell will begin their quest to leapfrog Ross County out of the play-off spot with a local Friday night derby against Hamilton. The Fir Park side face Partick Thistle on the final day of the season, while St Mirren face Hamilton.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Jordon Ibe is on the verge of signing a new long-term contract as Brendan Rodgers prepares to re-launch the exciting teenager’s season. Liverpool offered Ibe fresh terms in February after he had a deep impression in a sequence of games, particularly against Everton and Tottenham, that coincided with an improvement in the club’s fortunes. A deal has now been agreed and it is simply a case of the highly-regarded Ibe, who has been absent since damaging knee ligaments against Besiktas on February 26, putting pen to paper. Jordon Ibe in training for Liverpool at Melwood as he prepares to make a return from injury . Ibe is set to sign a new long-term deal at Liverpool after breaking into the first team this season . Rodgers says Ibe, 19, has looked ‘absolutely sensational’ after stepping up his rehabilitation work in the last couple of weeks and he could come straight back into the starting line-up against Newcastle on Monday night. The issue Rodgers must address is whether to stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used at Blackburn in the FA Cup last Wednesday or revert to the 3-4-3 system that had been the catalyst for an improvement in results. One thing Liverpool’s manager has conceded, though, is that Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season, given all the injuries he has suffered. Ibe, pictured in action against Tottenham, damaged his knee ligaments while playing against Besiktas . Sturridge, who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games, admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year’s sparkle and his manager agrees, following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh, calf and hip issues. ‘It’s a long time out,’ said Rodgers. ‘When you’re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. ‘The key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt, a total run at pre-season and hopefully he’ll be fine for next season. Until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him.’ Brendan Rodgers prepares his Liverpool team for the visit of Newcastle to Anfield on Monday . Daniel Sturridge is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off . Rodgers added: ‘Every player is different. With Daniel there’s been a number of injuries that he’s had and that’s before he came here. He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult. ‘He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that isn’t all down to you — sometimes it’s about luck as well.’',\n",

Alex Tettey’s early own goal handed the Carrow Road visitors a slim victory and threw the title race wide open with just two points separating the top four after last night’s match. They could be overtaken on Saturday when Bournemouth, who relinquished first place, play their game in hand against Sheffield Wednesday and Watford, the fourth team with a strong chance, host Birmingham this afternoon.

But Karanka insisted: ‘This last week for us has been amazing. We have won three games in six days, especially against Norwich when everyone thought they would beat us. ‘I’m proud of my players. Once again they showed when they play their best they can beat everyone. I told them after the game if there is a team who deserve to be in Premier League it’s them. ‘The last game on May 2 we’ll see which team will get promotion but I think it’ ll go to the last second.’ Tettey’s mistake could prove costly in one of the most exciting end-of-season run-ins after it ended a run of eight games unbeaten for his side. Karanka admitted before the match that if his side lost they would have been cut too far adrift from the front runners, but all remains to play for now. The strong away contingent had settled easily in Norwich’s Riverside entertainment park ahead of kick-off and their team comfortably matched them on the pitch, in unfamiliar surroundings away from their Riverside Stadium, in the opening exchanges. Twenty minutes after the game had started and the home side had barely got out of their own half while Middlesbrough carved out chance after chance. One of those, in the ninth minute, produced the opener. Middlesbrough had lost back-to-back away matches - against promotion rivals Bournemouth and Watford - for the first time this season before the match, so their lead was a surprise. So, too, was the look on Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy’s face when Adam Clayton sent in a corner from the left and his own midfielder Tettey headed the ball at the near post over him and into the far right of goal. It had been coming. Four minutes in and full-back Tomas Kalas burst on the overlap down the right to cross for Jelle Vossen whose header was deflected wide. Two minutes later Albert Adomah, again on their right flank, feinted a cross and turned back on himself before playing the ball to Patrick Bamford. His flick-on found Vossen again and his half-volley arrowed towards the top right corner but went just over. ‘The first 15 minutes cost us the game,’ Norwich manager Alex Neil admitted. ‘After that, we didn’t do enough to win the game. At this stage of the season it is about making a difference and we didn’t do that. ‘In terms of effort and endeavour I couldn't question them – they gave everything they had. It looks more likely that we are going to be involved in the play-offs so what we need to do now is dust ourselves off.’ Norwich midfielder Wes Hoolahan (left) tries to run past Boro's Adam Clayton during Friday's encounter .

Tempers flared in the dying embers of the match as both sets of players got to grips with one another . Middlesbrough continued to dominate but with Norwich’s first chance of the game on 20 minutes they really should have been level.\\xa0The foray forward saw Bradley Johnson head a ball into the box back across goal and Jonny Howson had a free header six yards out but failed to find the target. It was, however, the catalyst for the home side to get a foothold in the game and their pressure mounted from then on until the final whistle went after seven minutes of stoppage time. A fierce intensity gripped proceedings with the home side unable to capitalise on their growing possession. The sold-out stadium roared their team on and they even threw Ruddy up at the end for a series of corners. It peaked in the final few moments when, from one of those corners, Middlesbrough defender Ben Gibson threw himself in front of Russell Martin’s volley to prevent what would have been a certain goal. That block could be worth millions. Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka gives instructions to his team as they try to hold on to their lead .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has not ruled out the prospect of Antolin Alcaraz or Sylvain Distin earning new contracts but stressed they need to prove they can still be important figures in the club's future. Both centre-backs' current deals expire this summer and it seems highly unlikely Distin, who is 38 in December and has played more for the under-21s in the last month than he has the first team, will be retained. Alcaraz, 33 in July, has more of a chance of securing a short-term extension as Martinez looks to strengthen and restructure his defence in the summer. Roberto Martinez insists 37-year-old defender Sylvain Distin still has time to prove he deserves a new deal . Antolin Alcaraz, who joined Everton from Wigan where he played under Martinez, could get a new deal . While the Toffees boss is keen to advance the talents of younger players - Tyias Browning and Brendan Galloway the two most likely to benefit - he has not ruled out retaining existing senior players. 'There are only two players out of contract and we have two loan players (Aaron Lennon and Christian Atsu) and those decisions will be made when we have finished the season,' said Martinez. 'The next six games could have a massive bearing on that. Ninety minutes is a big opportunity to change people's views. 'All individuals will be judged over that period. In football it does not matter if you have a contract or not, you always need to improve and show the right attitude and show you are ready to be part of the future of the club. 'But when you get players at the end of their contract there are decisions to be made and it is not just the club, it is the player as well.' Roberto Martinez says his club's recruitment team have been searching for targets for six months . Distin has played more for Everton's youth team than the first XI in the past month, and could be on his way . Martinez said they have established a list of transfer targets for the summer and, while he would not confirm publicly, Aston Villa's on-loan Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley, out of contract at the end of the season, is believed to be one of them. 'The recruitment department has been working really hard over the last six months and we need to assemble a really strong squad,' Martinez said. 'First and foremost it is an opportunity for young players to show they are ready for big important roles for next campaign and everyone else providing strong competition to be important figures for the future. Tom Cleverley, who is on loan at Aston Villa, is a target, with Martinez having worked with him before . 'The dressing room is very strong as it is now, so we need to make sure whatever we do in the summer is to get us in a better place. 'We know the situation with Tom. He is a player that I know well having worked with him (in a previous loan spell at Wigan) - and that's it.

Vaughan is currently in the West Indies working as part of the BBC's commentary team but has made no secret in his desire to replace Paul Downton in the top job in English cricket.

Pietersen’s quest for an improbable return to international cricket began as his scriptwriter must have known it would: with sumptuous strokes, a standing ovation and much of the old bravado. The fact that his first hundred since the Old Trafford Test against Australia in August 2013 came against a modest attack, at a windswept Oxford, in a game not deemed first-class, is beside the point. Pietersen’s only hope of playing for England again is to score lots of runs for Surrey – wind, rain or shine. Here was the first box ticked, in style. Surrey's Kevin Pietersen (right) celebrates reaching his 100 during the three-day Match at The Parks . Pietersen makes his way out to the crease following the dismissal of Rory Burns . It was the 34-year-old's first appearance for Surrey since the LV= County Championship in June 2013 . Asked what Graves had said to him when the pair spoke over the phone last month, Pietersen replied: ‘He said he wants the best players playing for England, and everyone has a clean slate. Right now, it’s just about me hitting the red ball. I think it can help England going forward. ‘I took confidence from the way I played in Australia [at the Big Bash]. It was as well as I’ve ever batted. I’ve been given a lifeline, and I have an opportunity to get back to doing something I love that was taken away from me prematurely.’ England meet West Indies in Antigua on Monday, and comparisons will be inevitable. There will be mixed feelings both in the Caribbean and at Lord’s. Whether Pietersen’s journey will prove more futile than fruitful is another matter. The first aim of the new regime at the ECB has been to stop the sniping; the second may be to keep Pietersen sweet in case English cricket needs him after he retires, possibly in a mentoring capacity. Regardless, the evidence here – as if it were required – suggested he is deadly serious about reclaiming his place. Pietersen has played exclusively Twenty20 cricket throughout the world since being axed by England . A young spectator points to a dent in her mother's car made by one of Pietersen's shots . Pietersen made 62 on his only prior appearance at The Parks, for Nottinghamshire in April 2004 . With Surrey 122 for five at lunch, Pietersen (left) found himself on 47 not out from 58 balls . Nearly 10 years on from his Ashes-clinching century at The Oval, Pietersen cannot have imagined he would need to prosper in the Parks simply to stay afloat. But in front of a crowd of several hundred – almost unheard of in these parts – and with Surrey stumbling to 113 for five, he had a captive audience and a job to do. Pietersen was careful at first, waiting until his eighth delivery to pinch his first run in red-ball cricket since the Sydney Test of January 2014, and not finding the boundary until his 31st. Then he opened up. His fifty came from 63 balls, his hundred from 110, and his 150 from 137. By the time he was out for 170, caught at mid-on off the bowling of Abidine Sahande, a human sciences undergrad from St John’s College, the total was only 310. He knocked one spectator off his stool with a fierce drive, dented a Peugeot 207 with the first of two successive straight sixes, and unveiled his full repertoire. Stealing headlines and causing damage, Pietersen might never have been away. Pietersen's inclusion in Surrey's line-up attracted several hundred spectators and a number of photographers .\",\n",

The 16-year-old was part of the Chelsea Under 19 team that won the UEFA Youth League by beating Shakhtar Donetsk in Monday's final in Nyon, Switzerland. And former Arsenal and England striker Wright took to Twitter to praise him, saying: 'Congrats to Chelsea winning UEFA youth league. Jay da silva left back better player than any current prem left back.' Jay Dasilva has been praised by Ian Wright following his performances in the UEFA Youth League . Dasilva is better than any current Premier League left-back, according to Wright . Wright has predicted that four of the Chelsea side are set for a bright future in the game . In a later tweet, Wright also tipped Dasilva's team-mates Tammy Abraham, Charly Musonda and Charlie Colkett to enjoy bright futures in the game. Chelsea became the first English team to win the Youth League after two goals from captain Izzy Brown and another from Dominic Solanke led them to a 3-2 win. Dasilva, who hails from Luton and was signed by Chelsea aged 12, is an attack-minded left back who can also operate as a winger. Despite a slight build, he is able to make his presence felt and is quick going forward in possession of the ball and when tracking back. The Chelsea team pose with the UEFA Youth League trophy after their triumph in Nyon on Monday . Izzy Brown is buried beneath a pile of his team-mates after scoring Chelsea's opening goal . Dominic Solanke celebrates after scoring Chelsea's second goal against Shakhtar Donetsk . He progressed quickly from the Under 15 team to the Under 18 side last season and helped Chelsea to their FA Youth Cup win over Fulham. He scored in the first leg at Craven Cottage. This season has seen further progress, with Dasilva making eight appearances in the Under 21 Premier League and nine in the Youth League run. He recently helped England's Under 17 team to this summer's European Championship finals and is set to feature in the tournament in Bulgaria next month. Abraham, the 17-year-old forward, has enjoyed a prolific season for the Chelsea Under 18 side, scoring 24 times in the league at that age group and adding four more in the Youth League. His six goals have helped Chelsea to a fifth FA Youth Cup final in six seasons - they will play Manchester City in the final, with the first leg scheduled for Monday.

Colkett, 18, is a central midfielder who played a part in each game during Chelsea's Youth League run and has also played for the Under 21s.

Locals said they could smell \\xa0petrol when the water surfaced, and blame the pollution on a leak from a local gas petrol station, a claim which the owner denies . However, when Chinese officials investigated, they said they could find no trace of a spillage, leading some people to theorise that the villagers could have struck oil.

Tuo Zhijun, a villager in Ansai, said: 'Who knew when we turned on the pump, once the water was seeping through, everyone could smell gas and see oil slick.'

Roach, Pacquiao’s trainer, said he rated super-middleweight star Andre Ward and middleweight sensation Gennady Golovkin above Mayweather despite the American’s unbeaten record and his status as hot favourite for the May 2 showdown against Pacquiao. ‘Mayweather is undefeated so you have to give him a little credit for that,’ said Roach, ‘but he has picked and chosen his opponents and I don’t think he’s fought enough competition to be considered the best. You have to fight the best to be the best, I feel. He’s ducked a lot of guys. Manny Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach says that Floyd Mayweather cannot be considered best ever . Roach says that Mayweather has picked and chosen his fights during his career . ‘Manny has had some devastating losses in his career but he is a realist. He understands that losing is part of the game and if you don’t think you are going to get knocked out in this sport, you have picked the wrong sport. I’d put Ward and Triple G above Mayweather right now. They are very talented guys and very polished boxers.’ Roach has been vocal in an otherwise low-key and surprisingly respectful build-up to the welterweight showdown next month and knows that his tactics have made the stakes even higher for him. But he is adamant Pacquiao will spring a surprise in the most eagerly awaited fight for years. ‘The fight will be won and lost on the ropes,’ said Roach. ‘If Mayweather goes to the ropes and tries to rest his legs, he will get beat. If he has good movement the entire night and his legs don’t give out on him, he’ll probably win. It’s about outscoring him. If he sits on the ropes, we can outscore him. If he stays in the middle of the ring and boxes all the time he could possibly outscore us.’ Roach claimed Pacquiao is in the best shape of his life, moving faster and punching harder than ever before. ‘He trains harder than any fighter I have ever had in my life,’ said Roach. ‘I have had 33 world champions and nobody can touch him for his work ethic. His attitude is good. ‘This fight can send out a message about what we need to do in boxing. When the best fights the best, do you see how big this is? Someone needs to wake up and put the best with the best all the time. Because when that happens, we have the best sport in the world. I don’t care who likes who, you can still negotiate business. Roach rates super middleweight Andre Ward higher than he does undefeated Mayweather . Roach, who has trained Pacquiao for 15 years, says the Filipino is in the best shape of his life . ‘It’s a better fight today than it was five years ago because they were both a lot faster and more mobile five years ago and it might have been more of a boxing match but now they’re a little bit older, it’s going to be a better fight. ‘I believe Manny can win this fight. I kind of have to win this fight. I’ve been talking a lot. It’s more important than anything to me. It’s more important to me than getting my girlfriend, Maya, back. It’s that big because, I mean, I really like this girl. ‘My mother told me, “You must like her; you put her Christmas tree up for her, you bought her a car and those earrings you bought her cost £14,000 each”. ‘After this fight maybe I’ll try to get her back.’\",\n",

O'Connor's time of two minutes 09:51 seconds was the fastest recorded in the world this year and came comfortably inside the World Championships qualification mark of 2:10:20. Hannah Miley took the silver medal with a time of 2:11:65 and Aimee Willmott claimed bronze in 2:13:30. Siobhan-Marie O'Connor celebrates with second-placed Hannah Miley (left) and third-placed Aimee Willmott . O'Connor, who is the reigning Commonwealth champion, was short of her 2:08.21 personal best - a British record - but said making the team for Russia was her main focus. 'I'm chuffed, the (qualifying) times are a massive challenge but it means everyone has to step up and race world class times,' O'Connor said. 'I'm really just happy to have made the team. It was really tough. I'm happy with that time, I just wanted to go under 2.10. 'I would have ideally liked to have been closer to my personal best but sometimes you're not on your best form. To get the qualifying time was my main aim.' O'Connor's time of two minutes 09:51 seconds was the fastest recorded in the world this year . The performance of O'Connor, who won 100m freestyle gold on Tuesday, is particularly impressive considering the heavy disruptions to her winter training programme. The pool at the University of Bath, where the 19-year-old has trained for most of her career, has been closed for six months renovation meaning she and her group have been forced to relocate 32 miles away at Millfield School. 'It has been hard over the last six months,' O'Connor added. 'It has been a challenge but everyone has challenges in sport. 'It's just something we have to deal with. It couldn't have been any better and I'm proud to have adapted to it. 'It's definitely been tough, we've all felt that. Our pool is open in Bath after this though so I'm looking forward to getting back there and getting some consistency again.' The 19-year-old claimed two titles despite heavy disruptions to her winter training programme . Jazz Carlin followed up her success in the 400m freestyle on Wednesday with a dominant performance in the 800m freestyle to win another gold medal. Carlin clocked 8:21:58 which was enough to seal the title but she missed the World Championships qualifying time of 8:21:22. The Commonwealth and European champion is still likely to race the 800m in Russia, after finishing more than 10 seconds clear of Jessica Thielmann (8:32:19) in second and Camilla Hattersley in third (8:37:99).

One featured penalty Celtic didn't get for 2-0 in which Josh Meekings handball should have also led to a sending off. The other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon. 'I've not seen it yet, but going by the reaction of the Celtic players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game,' acknowledged Caley manager John Hughes after. Inverness's Josh Meekings appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over Celtic . Caley boss John Hughes says the break, which could have meant a penalty and red card, was a turning point . 'I've not spoken to Josh. I haven't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball. We look at the referee behind the line and all that and I know Ronny will feel aggrieved - because I certainly would. 'But it's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat Celtic. 'This was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the Scottish Cup. 'But when Marley Watkins was clipped by Craig Gordon and they were down to 10 men that was advantage Inverness. 'We weren't going to give Celtic the ball back, they had to come and get it and we had to be patient. 'When big Edward put us into the lead we thought it was going to be our day on the back of things that had happened. 'Celtic equalised with another free kick but it's typical of Inverness that we don't do anything easy. 'We do it the hard way and we came up with the winner through David Raven.' Hughes hauled Raven, his Scouse defender, from his backside as extra-time beckoned. Offended by the sight of one of his players resting he had a message to impart. Caley players celebrate after upsetting Celtic in a Scottish Cup semi-final 3-2 thriller . Celtic, depleted by games and absentees, were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games. In last season's League Cup Final Inverness had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties. This was no time to repeat the mistake. 'I tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat Celtic, down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup. We needed to go for it,' Hughes said. 'Before Raven scored at the back post I was looking to change it. I was going to bring on another winger, Aaron Doran, and put him in the full-back position over on the right, but more advanced so he could take their left back on. Thankfully I didn't do that and David Raven came up with the goal. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute . 'I didn't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the Scottish Cup and that's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago. 'It is a great story isn't it? It's an absolutely fantastic story. It is 20 odd years since the amalgamation. We are a small provincial club up there in the Highlands. 'We have lost a real inspirational skipper in Richie Foran right from the start of the season. He has never played. We have had to adjust to that. 'We had to sell Billy McKay, our top goalscorer, at Christmas. We have had to go again and adjust. I am a very humble guy and I am grateful and thankful that injuries have never caught up with us.' There is remarkable irony in the fact Falkirk will be the opponents for the final. A former Bairns captain, he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to Rangers at Hampden. Former Falkirk captain and manager John Hughes will take on his former club in the final . 'I had a lot of great times at Falkirk. So much so that it is possibly my favourite time in my playing career. I am still friendly with an awful lot of the characters who were in that dressing room. Neil Oliver is a good friend of mine from my Falkirk days. He comes along and sits on the bench and gives me a wee hand out. 'That is the spirit that we had at that club. I have met some great guys. Brian Rice, my ex-coach, Davie Weir, Ian McCall, the list is endless. I was just talking the other day about that day at Falkirk. There are times even now when I see. 'I have a real special, special feel for the place. I am not kidded Falkirk is a right good side, trust me on that. No side goes to Tynecastle and beats Hearts without being a good side. No side beats Hibs the way they were playing without being a good side. You might say we are favourites I say it is even stevens and I am just looking forward to when the days comes.' David Raven (second right) celebrates with his\\xa0Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner . An Inverness and Falkirk final would not have been the choice of sponsors William Hill, you suspect. Vast swathes of Hampden's west stand were empty, a 12.15 kick-off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful . There will be no ticket rows this time. Not over a final unlikely to raise a crowd much higher than 35,000 in a stadium of 52,000. The contract with Hampden plc is signed, with no question of moving it. If the bitter amalgamation of 21 years ago produced a fine football club it also disenfranchised many of those who followed the old ones. 'I hope this encourages the next generation to follow Inverness,' added Hughes. 'In the peer groups it is still Celtic and Rangers they follow but I hope the next ones will want to support their local club. 'If we can add another few hundred or thousand to the support then we are playing our part.'\",\n",

Sterling is stalling on a new £100,000-a-week contract offer, although he insists it has nothing to do with money and he will reassess his options at the end of the season. The 20-year-old, who has been linked with a number of Europe's top clubs, was one of four players at the Anfield launch of next season's New Balance kit in front of over 1,000 fans, with one shouting from the crowd 'Make sure we see you in it next season'. Liverpool's attacking midfielder Raheem Sterling is stalling on a new big-money contract at the Anfield club . Sterling (centre right) poses with Martin Skrtel (left), Simon Mignolet (centre left) and Daniel Sturridge (right) The four Liverpool players huddle together on stage at the launch of their new home kit for next season . Sturridge uploaded this to his Instagram account as he posed with Sterling, Mignolet and Skrtel at the launch . Sturridge posed with his team-mates and uploaded these snaps to his Instagram account . That made the youngster slightly more uncomfortable than he already was perched on a stool on stage, and speaking afterwards Sturridge said having regular football - which he is virtually guaranteed at Liverpool but possibly not elsewhere - was a key consideration for Sterling. 'I don't know what Raheem wants to do but it is just important to be able to play regularly,' he told Press Association Sport. 'As long as he is playing regularly he will be happy - I don't think it is anything to with anything other than that and I hope he will stay at the club. 'It is important, regardless of who you are, to show what you can do - not just for Raheem but any young player. 'It is important to play games and gain experience so whatever decision he makes I am behind him 100 per cent.' Sturridge experienced something similar himself when he left Manchester City for Chelsea aged 19 but things did not pan out how he would have liked at Stamford Bridge and he left for Liverpool in January 2012 after 63 appearances in four years. As he matured he has enjoyed greater success at Anfield, scoring 40 goals in 67 appearances but his good form was interrupted this season by a five-month absence with a thigh problem. Since returning in January he has scored four times in 15 games and some of his performances have drawn criticism simply because he has not matched the heights of last season when, playing alongside Luis Suarez, he scored 24 times. Daniel Sturridge is bidding to return to his best form following a lengthy spell out through injury . However, the England striker knew he would not rediscover his best form immediately, which he believes will only come with a full pre-season under his belt. 'It has taken time to get back into the groove. I have missed a lengthy time and gaining sharpness while playing games is not easy in a league like the Premier League - you can't ease yourself back in because the games are very fast,' he added. 'It has been a difficult season in terms of the injuries but I know I will come back strong and get back to exactly how I was performing before. 'It is going to take time, it is not going to happen overnight, I understand that. 'It is the sharpness and fitness side of things. It takes a long time and that is the whole point of having a long pre-season. 'I am looking forward to helping the team this season and towards next season I will be right back to where I was, because I would have had a pre-season I will be back to the sharpness and fitness levels I had before.' Sturridge has been criticised by some supporters for failing to hit the same heights he did last season .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Diego Simeone is made for England. Though his collapse under the weight of a mere brush with David Beckham’s boot in 1998 saw him characterised as the antithesis of Anglo-Saxon values, he is, in reality, more English than the English. For that night in St Etienne - almost the last time an England team truly thrilled a global audience at the World Cup, even if they did so in defeat – is remembered by Simeone for more than his notorious role in Beckham’s sending off, which left England down to ten men for most of the match. 'That game was the best international match I've played in,' said Simeone, remembering the World Cup knock out match, which Argentina won on penalties after a 2-2 draw. Given that he played 106 times for his country that is some compliment. Diego Simeone is hoping to lead Atletico Madrid to second successive Champions League final . England's David Beckham kicks out at former midfielder midfielder Simeone during the 1998 World Cup . 'I love playing against the English,’ Simeone added. ‘They're so passionate, so aggressive, so committed. They were incredible that night. Alan Shearer and Paul Ince were extraordinary. At times it seemed Shearer was fighting us on his own. You have to remember they played for 70 minutes with 10 men.’ And as Simeone stalked out on to the pitch at the end of the Champions League final last year, in full confrontational mode, seeking out Raphael Varane, who had kicked the ball at the Atletico bench in celebration of Real Madrid’s 4-1 win, it was hard to not to get the image of the warrior footballer out of your head. There is much more to Simeone than that of course. He had come within two minutes of winning that Champions League final on a wage bill which was famously less than QPR’s. Since that defeat, he has exacted his revenge at every turn. Real Madrid were beaten in the Spanish Super Cup over two legs, then knocked out of the Copa del Rey, also over two legs, by Atletico, beaten at the Bernebeu and then, most spectacularly , beaten 4-0 at the Vicente Calderon last February. Beckham looks towards the referee during the World Cup clash between England and Argentina . The former England man was shown a red card for lashing out at Simeone during the knock-out match . Last week the teams drew 0-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final; on Wednesday they resume hostilities at the Bernebeu. Real may be marginal favourites but under Simeone, Atletico have gone from the side that could never beat Real Madrid – they hadn’t won for 14 years against them – to the side that (almost) never loses to them. What is always unclear to outside observers is how the man famed for his confrontations and aggression became one of the most tactically astute coaches in Europe. Of course, he always had leadership qualities and undeniable charisma. In his native Argentina they always assumed he would be a manager, such was his dominance of the national team as a captain. But his early results were very mixed. He looked innovative and the man to watch at Estudiantes, where he was one of the first to use motivational video clips from films to inspire his players. It worked: they chased down Boca Juniors for the league title even if he was, in those days, criticised for being overly focused on attacking players. At River Plate though, it looked as if fighting talk and charisma only got you so far. He finished bottom of the league and had to resign. The Atleti boss confronts Raphael Varane during Real Madrid's 4-1 Champions League final win last year . Simeone speaks to referee Bjorn Kuipers during the showpiece final at the Estadio da Luz . He revived his reputation somewhat at Catania and Racing but when he was given the Atletico job in 2011, it seemed more like the old boys’ network at work – he was an iconic player there in the 1990s – than the result of a meticulous recruitment process scouring the best tactical minds in Europe . Of course, the success has been unrelenting, with a trophy every year: the Europa League in 2012; the Copa Del Rey in 2013, beating Jose Mourinho’s Real in the final; and the extraordinary feat of wining La Liga ahead of Barca and Real last season. This year he is comfortably-placed for another Champions League spot but the title is out of the question. Carlo Ancelotti though is right to be nervous ahead of Wednesday’s quarter final. If there were a team for the big occasion, it is Simeone’s Atletico. The 44-year-old got the better of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho during his side's 3-1 victory at Stamford Bridge . He makes a habit of out-witting Europe’s best minds. It isn’t just Ancelotti who has been his victim. Mourinho, too, back in that 2013 cup final and then again last season, when Atletico stunned Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Having brought the game back to 1-1 and being ahead on away goals, you might have expected Simeon’s side to sit back. But they came out for the second half pressing even harder, pushing forwards whenever they could. In effect, Simone did precisely what the opposition least expected and were rewarded with a 3-1 win. And yet there is something very English about Simeone’s style. It’s not just the frequent use of 4-4-2, the wide men, the directness of their play at time and the physicality - it’s their fighting spirit which characterises them and which might be stamped: ‘Made in England.’ It’s why Simeone so related to Shearer and Ince and their performance in that extraordinary 2-2 draw in St Etienne. Ince, Shearer, Simeone; they’re all cast from the same mould. The Argentine manager is understandably adored by the Atletico faithful despite his team's combative style . The Atletico players circle around Simeone as they prepare for the Champions League clash against Madrid . He’s not about to move, having just signed a new contract with Atletico until 2020 and we may never see him in the Premier League. The problem for Simone is that his English values are no longer fashionable in England. When Manchester City choose a new manager, it will be someone who can help to bring tiki taka football to the club, from academy to the first team, under the direction of Txiki Begiristain. When Arsenal appoint, pretty football rather than fighting spirit are likely to be high up the agenda of the new coach. Manchester United, now establishment, might baulk at a street fighter as manager, though they had one once before and he didn’t do so badly. He would be adored at Liverpool, but it would be another gear change from the Brendan Rodgers style that the club has embraced. Chelsea, too, though falling back on Mourinho, also have had the Barcelona model in mind and are thought to be unimpressed with Simeone. Maybe he has simply made too many enemies over the years. But Simeone is useful antidote to those who think English football’s traditional strengths have no place in the modern game. Perhaps he’s just become too English for the new England . Atletico and Real Madrid drew 0-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final . Simeone is tossed \\xa0in the air by his players as they celebrate their Spanish league title last season .\",\n",

Klopp revealed on Wednesday that he will not be fulfilling the remainder of his contract, which was due to expire in 2018. Instead, he will be terminating his agreement with the Westphalians in the summer to seek a new challenge, but he has vowed to win as many games as he can before bringing his seven-year reign to an end. Jurgen Klopp (centre) speaks to Mats Hummels (left) during Borussia Dortmund's Thursday training session . The Borussia Dortmund coach leads the team's training session as they prepare for a German league match against Paderborn this weekend . And he expects the players to do the same, insisting they will be fully focused for Saturday's Bundesliga clash with Paderborn. 'We can draw strength from this story together,' Klopp said at Thursday's press conference. 'We've always been able to find reasons to do something quite special.' Klopp relayed the reactions of the players to his decision to the assembled press, saying: 'Nobody applauded me - so I guess that's a good thing. You need a moment to deal with such information, which is why I didn't really assess much of what happened in training (on Wednesday), but that's over now. Klopp announced his departure from Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday after seven years . Klopp said he believed Dortmund needed a change of manager, but has urged his team to keep smiling . 'I want to see the players smiling, even if then somebody might write that the players are glad Klopp's leaving.' The fans will have had a few days to digest the news too, by the time Dortmund run out at the Westfalenstadion on Saturday, and Klopp expects the atmosphere to be no different to usual. 'If somebody feels they need to give me or my coaching team three cheers, then they would be wrong,' he added. Klopp has already been linked with a number of leading clubs around Europe . Klopp won the Bundesliga title twice during his seven years as Dortmund manager . 'I don't expect it and I don't need it. The important thing is that they get behind the team for 90 minutes.' Earlier on Thursday, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger refused to add to the speculation over whether Klopp's next assignment will be in the Barclays Premier League. Klopp insisted on Wednesday that he had had no contact with any clubs, but stressed he did not plan to take an extended time-out from the game. The German has been installed as favourite to replace the under-fire Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City, but Wenger was keen not to add fuel to the fire when quizzed on the matter. 'I'm not an agency to place managers and I like every manager and respect everybody, but I find that circus a bit ridiculous,' the Frenchman said. On whether Klopp would suit Arsenal, Wenger said: 'I already answered this question.' Wenger does not believe Dortmund players will necessarily look to follow the charismatic 47-year-old out of the Westfalenstadion. The emotion was clear to see as Klopp announced he was leaving the club at a Wednesday press conference . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger branded the 'circus' around Klopp's decision as 'ridiculous' 'It's down to every club to make the right decision and to respect Dortmund,' he said. 'Dortmund is a massive club and will survive, and has the ability to keep their best players. 'They have a big history linked with great results and great achievements, so I don't think that will stop for Dortmund.' Klopp has enjoyed a hugely successful spell in charge of Dortmund since taking over in 2008, leading the club to two Bundesliga titles, DFB-Pokal success and the Champions League final. This season has been more of a struggle, with the club battling it out at the bottom end of the league for much of the campaign and currently sitting 10th. Asked about any advice he would give to foreign managers heading to the Premier League, Wenger replied: 'Try to get your ideas through and adapt as well to the local culture, and respect it.'\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"A defence of his crown will be a priority for Grand National hero Many Clouds next season, and trainer Oliver Sherwood has also floated the possibility of a rematch with his Cheltenham Gold Cup conqueror Coneygree in Newbury’s Hennessy Gold Cup. That race in November has already been identified as a likely target for Coneygree and, even allowing for a rise in his handicap mark, Many Clouds would receive weight from his rival. With 11st 9lb on his back, Leighton Aspell’s mount carried the biggest weight to victory on Saturday since Red Rum won his second National in 1974 at under 12st. Many Clouds, winner of Saturday's Grand National, is shown off\\xa0during a parade in Lambourn on Sunday . Fans line the streets to pay their well-wishes to the Grand National winning horse . Has AP McCoy finally found his nemesis in Oliver Sherwood? Trainer Sherwood, a Chelsea supporter, and Arsenal fan McCoy have had a regular bet on whose team will finish highest in the Premier League. Sherwood, who ensured the retiring McCoy did not sign off with Grand National glory, said: ‘We have had double or quits, but I have never had to give him anything!’ Sherwood’s desire to return to the National with Many Clouds — the 2014 Hennessy winner who also came sixth in the Gold Cup — rather than prioritise the Gold Cup, is influenced by the fact that with a weight ceiling of 11st 10lb, the gelding will have to carry only an extra pound. Sherwood said: ‘He has nothing to lose by going for the Gold Cup as there is no point me protecting his handicap mark over hurdles. But, having said that, and having seen all the novices that Willie Mullins has, we might just train him for the National and if Coneygree goes for the Hennessy, it would be a very interesting option.’ The training centre of Lambourn in Berkshire was packed on Sunday to welcome its first winner of the £1million Crabbie’s-sponsored race since Jenny Pitman’s Royal Athlete 20 years ago. Among the well-wishers at Sherwood’s Rhonehurst stable, where 1938 National winner Battleship was trained, were Flat trainers Charlie Hills and Jamie Osborne as well as Sherwood’s brother Simon, best known as one of the jockeys to ride the great Desert Orchid. Aspell, the first to ride back-to-back winners on different horses since the 1950s, having landed the race 12 months ago on Pineau de Re, was in action at Market Rasen, where he was unplaced in one ride, but Many Clouds owner Trevor Hemmings, who also owns the Blackpool Tower and Preston North End, as well as a third Grand National winner that he bought for only €6,000 (£4,350), flew in by helicopter from his Isle Of Man home. Many Clouds held his nerve over the closing stages ahead of AP McCoy who was riding Shutthefrontdoor . Winning jockey Leighton Aspell (left) and Many Clouds owner Trevor Hemmings (right) celebrate after victory . The resurgent Sherwood, eighth as a jockey on Venture To Cognac in Corbiere’s 1983 National, had saddled four previous National runners but none had finished. He joked: ‘My record was s*** — it could only get better.’ Fifth-placed Shutthefrontdoor will also be looking to return to Aintree next year, but not, of course, his jockey AP McCoy. He is expected to return to action at Cheltenham on Wednesday and now has only 11 possible racing days until he retires after Sandown’s seasonal finale meeting on April 25. One of the most memorable sights at Saturday’s race was Ruby Walsh becoming a temporary flag man to help wave the field around the Canal Turn on the second circuit. Balthazar King, who was down on the landing side of that fence, suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung but was showing good signs of recovery on Sunday. Leighton Aspell, right, celebrates after winning the Grand National horse race aboard Many Clouds .

Two horses died at the meeting, Warren Greatrex’s Seedling on Saturday and Alan King’s Grade One winner Balder Succes, was put down on Sunday \\xa0because of injuries sustained in a fall in Friday’s Melling Chase. But a third National with no fatalities since the fences were given softer cores is proof that welfare changes have made a difference to the track. That is underlined by the fact that in that time, in all races over the fences, there have been 395 runners and only one horse has suffered fatal injuries as a result of a fall.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"The records are tumbling and Leicester’s belief is growing. Their 2-0 victory over Swansea made it three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000, lifting Nigel Pearson’s side to 17th and ending their five-month spell at the bottom. All this after just two wins in their previous 24 games. Most looking at the club reasoned relegation would be a matter of time. Instead, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley, Hull and Sunderland are now shorter odds to go down with bookmakers. In truth, there have been no significant changes to affect results. Pearson has applied the same principles throughout the season, except now Leicester are taking more chances. Here Sportsmail assesses the key themes of Leicester’s revival. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after scoring against Swansea during his side's 2-0 win . Scoring surge . Andy King’s late tap-in meant Leicester have scored two or more goals in a fourth consecutive top-flight match for the first time since May 2000. Previously, Leicester were creating plenty but fluffing their lines. Against Crystal Palace in February, for example, they had five shots on target, eight shots off target, six shots blocked – and failed to find the net, losing 1-0. They had six shots on target against Swansea, with a much better success rate. Andy King scores Leicester's second goal to seal three points against Swansea at the King Power Stadium . Cambiasso class . Ulloa scored his first Premier League goal in 647 minutes; last scoring on Boxing Day 2014. Esteban Cambiasso will surely be named Leicester’s player of the season come what may. The Argentine has sprinkled high quality to their midfield, winning possession and conducting play like a grand master plots chess moves. At 34, his experience is now shining through – a calm head even as circumstances appeared brittle. His goal to set up the win over West Ham was special too. His pass completion was not outstanding against Swansea – just 68.3 per cent – but that is largely because he tried difficult balls to get his team on the front foot. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso puts in another classy performance against Swansea on Saturday . Schmeichel sensational . With the score at 1-0, Swansea unlocked the Leicester defence to send Nelson Oliveira through on goal. Kasper Schmeichel was out in a flash, spreading himself large and deflecting the finish wide. It was a hugely important moment. The Danish goalkeeper was on the sidelines with a broken metatarsal for more than three months of this season, but has returned at peak form for this crucial period. Foxes goalkeeper\\xa0Kasper Schmeichel gets down quickly and makes himself big to save from Nelson Oliveria . Adept at adapting . Aside from Schmeichel’s injury, Pearson has been able to call a mainly full-strength squad most weeks. He has changed personnel – only Wes Morgan has more than 30 starts under his belt – and players appear fresh when other squads may be tiring. He is flexible with his tactics, changing during games to suit the situation. He is getting it right recently. Against West Bromwich Albion he began with 4-3-1-2 but switched to 3-5-2 when trailing at half-time. Against Swansea, he started with an attacking 3-4-1-2 but implemented a back four when ahead. King slides in with a strong challenge on Swansea's\\xa0Oliveria during the Premier League match on Saturday . Pearson’s strength . The Leicester manager has been on the touchline rather than high in the stands recently, and uses his position to effect rather than for show. He kept players motivated at the Hawthorns and used a break in play against Swansea to give an impromptu team talk. He has been in remarkable survivals before, at Carlisle, Southampton, and West Brom, and knows what is required. He has managed to keep the respect of the squad through his imposing personality even after the phantom sacking. The players have always supported him. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson gives instructions to his players ahead of the 2-0 win over Swansea . Belief building . The great escape theme was hummed loudly by Leicester fans at fullt-time, and atmospheres at the King Power Stadium have been very noisy for the wins over West Ham and Swansea. That will continue for four of the final six games, with home comfort looking vital. Burnley at Turf Moor awaits first, and Leonardo Ulloa, who scored the opening goal, insists Leicester must not let their intensity dip. He also thinks Leicester’s sustained spell in the relegation zone has equipped them with the psychological tools to claw their way up. ‘If you know this situation at the bottom you play different, the mentality is a little different,’ he said. ‘Now with a good result and we have to push on.’ A Leicester fan holds up a sign backing the team to win their battle against relegation this season .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"As Patrick Bamford fired home his 19th Middlesbrough goal of the season on Tuesday night, there was one question on everybody’s lips: can he make the grade at Chelsea next season? The 21-year-old striker has been prolific in his loan spells at Boro, Derby and MK Dons, so much so that Sportsmail understands his parent club are opening talks with him over a new deal. Needless to say it would see his wages rise from his current £7,500-a-week deal. He will also be given the chance to impress Jose Mourinho on Chelsea’s summer tour although at the end of it he is expected to go out on loan again. This time, though, Bamford will be sent to a Premier League club, preferably Aitor Karanka’s Middlesbrough should they join the Blues in the top flight. Scroll down for video . Patrcik Bamford (centre) scored in Middlesbrough's  their 2-1 Championship win over Wolves on Tuesday . Bamford reels away in celebration after netting his 19th goal of the season in all competitions for Boro . The 21-year-old's (centre) sparkling form has led his parent club Chelsea to open talks over a new deal . The worry is that it is the same tactic the club employed with Romelu Lukaku, who was eventually sold to Everton. But Bamford is a confident young man and will believe he can emulate Tottenham’s Harry Kane and force Chelsea’s hand. Bamford is currently one of 26 players out on loan from Stamford Bridge - five of which are rival frontmen - while academy forwards Dominic Solanke and Isaiah Brown have already won elevation to the senior set-up. Then there are Diego Costa, Loic Remy and Didier Drogba already competing for that sole striking role. The chances of Bamford making his mark next season, you feel, are slim. But then weren’t the chances of Kane scoring 29 goals for Spurs in his breakthrough season and then netting on his full England debut also outlandish? Bamford has already impressed Mourinho with his attitude. The striker was sat with his dad and Chelsea’s technical director two years ago when the manager walked in and boldly demanded of the youngster, ‘What do you want?’ He was encouraged by the reply. ‘To play for Chelsea,’ returned the well-mannered but equally brazen rookie. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) has been impressed with Bamford's attitude as well as his development . Romelu Lukaku (pictured in 2011) was sold to Everton in the summer after failing to make the grade . Chelsea youth product Dominic Solanke (centre) has won elevation to the first-team squad this season . Tottenham striker Harry Kane (left) has scored 29 goals in his breakthrough season for the club . Bamford has always achieved his goals in life - be it straight A grades at Nottingham High School, teaching himself Spanish and to play guitar or, indeed, scoring goals as a footballer. He left Mourinho in no doubt as to his ultimate ambition. Last summer, when Mourinho convinced Bamford that Middlesbrough was the best place for him, the manager dispensed with his cool exterior and hugged his player. ‘He was very emotional,’ recalls the 21-year-old. And there is the ace which Bamford holds - Mourinho likes him. In June he will line up alongside Spurs’ Kane for England at the Under 21 European Championships. Kane is just six weeks older and has plotted a similar path through the Football League. On Tuesday night he became Boro’s first player since 1990 to score 17 league goals in one season. The play-offs are Boro’s most likely destination. But for Bamford - favourite to land the Football League’s Young Player of the Year prize - the chance of a showcase match at Wembley is no bad thing. Asked to detail the aspects of his game which have improved this season, Bamford said: ‘I now know how to use my strength in that position (lone striker), and I can run a lot more.’ If Mourinho was listening it would have been music to his ears. For Bamford’s ability - the raw talent which persuaded Chelsea to prise him from Nottingham Forest as an 18-year-old after only 12 minutes of first-team football - has never been in question. That much was in evidence during the midweek win over Wolves. His goal was a ruthless combination of technique and instinct. At times he reminds you of a young Teddy Sheringham, but with more pace. But more eye-catching was the selfless pursuit of a hopeful punt forward when, after out-muscling and out-pacing his minders, he squared for a team-mate to score. There is, then, graft as well as craft. Silk allied to steel. But it is Bamford’s personality which is most endearing. Bamford scored in Middlesbrough's surprise FA Cup fourth round win at Manchester City on January 24 . The striker's style of play has been compared to ex-England and Tottenham forward Teddy Sheringham (left) After training every day he goes home and practises guitar for ‘one hour only’ because he doesn’t want to ‘p*** off the neighbours’. He already plays piano, violin and saxophone and is conversational in German as well as French. There was an offer from Harvard University to study economics, and he could even have followed his two sisters down a medicine and science route. He shunned all of that, however, for a career in football. Bamford knows what he wants, and so does Mourinho. He feels he is ready to make the grade at Chelsea. To do that, like Kane, he first needs the chance. Bamford enjoyed two loan spells at MK Dons before spending the second half of last season at Derby .\",\n",

But the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at Old Trafford until the summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes.

Zaha made just four appearances for Manchester United in two years with the club . ‘If you have played the game then it’s “well done” or “you should have passed here or there”. But when you haven’t played… I think people lose a bit of respect for you. I think they are thinking ‘well, he’s not played’. They don’t have anything to speak to you about. It’s a big thing.’ ‘There were so many rumours about me that were not true.

Eventually he spoke to new United boss Louis Van Gaal, who confirmed that he wasn't part of his first-team plans and so he headed back on a season-long loan deal to Palace, where he flourished under Alan Pardew, and the deal was made permanent in February this year.

Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim scored centuries as Bangladesh made 329 for six and Pakistan could only muster 250 in reply. Pakistan will have the chance to level the three-match series on Sunday when the second ODI takes place in Mirpur. Bangladesh celebrate beating fellow World Cup quarter-finalists Pakistan by 79 runs in Dhaka . Bangladesh elected to bat after winning the toss but struggled to 67 for two in the 20th over after Soumya Sarkar was run out by Wahab Riaz for 20 and Mahmudullah (five) was bowled by Rahat Ali. Tamim and Mushfiqur set about repairing Bangladesh's stuttering innings and did just that by putting on 178 runs in 21.4 overs for the third wicket, during which time Tamim notched his fifth ODI century. He continued to plunder runs with ease but went for one big shot too many against Wahab and was caught at mid-off to leave Bangladesh on 245 for three with nine overs left. His 135-ball knock of 132 included 15 fours and three sixes. Two sixes in the 43rd over took Mushfiqur into the nineties and he joined Iqbal in passing three figures by hitting Saeed Ajmal for successive fours in the 45th. Mushfiqur perished in the 48th over when he edged Wahab behind to depart for a 77-ball innings of 106 which included 13 fours and two sixes. Shakib Al Hasan (31) and Sabbir Rahman (15) scored 30 runs in 2.2 overs before falling to Wahab (four for 59) in the final over as the hosts set Pakistan 330 for victory. Bangladesh cricketer Tamim Iqbal plays a shot during the first One Day International cricket match in Dhaka . Pakistan cricket captain Azhar Ali plays a shot during the first One Day International cricket match in Dhaka . Azhar Ali and Sarfraz Ahmed put on 53 runs for the first wicket before the latter slog-swept Arafat Sunny to deep backward square leg to leave Pakistan one down in the 11th over. Mohammad Hafeez was then run out to leave Pakistan stuttering on 59 for two but there was some respite when Azhar notched his fifth ODI half-century in the 20th over to celebrate his first match as captain in fine style. He and Haris Sohail compiled 89 runs for the third wicket but Azhar departed for 72 when he edged behind and Haris was also walking back to the pavilion shortly after he passed 50. Fawad Alam joined Mohammad Rizwan at the crease but his stay was short - 14 runs from 19 balls - and he and Saad Nasim (nought) fell to Sunny in the 40th over as Pakistan limped to 217 for six with 10 overs to play. Igbal sends an impressive shot flying through the air as Bangladesh turn on the style against Pakistan . Pakistan required an unlikely 113 runs to win at that point and though Rizwan and Wahab put on 27 of those, their dismissals saw the end come quickly. Rizwan reached his half-century off 46 balls and went on to 67 from 58 but fell shortly after Wahab, slog-sweeping Rubel Hossain to Nasir Hossain. Junaid Khan was run out without facing a ball and Ajmal also failed to score as the last four wickets fell in nine balls for six runs. Sunny and Taskin Ahmed finished with three wickets apiece as Bangladesh celebrated. Bangladesh cricketer Taskin Ahmed reacts  after the dismissal of Pakistan cricket captain Azhar Ali .\",\n",

The 250-piece\\xa0Lilly Pulitzer for Target\\xa0collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel\\xa0that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor\\xa0from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the\\xa0#LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell\\xa0them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans\\xa0criticized\\xa0Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are\\xa0hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store .

Instead, Benaut's family opted for a smaller service at the Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park attended only by family and close friends. Benaud's former teammate, Brian Booth, led the service. In the memorial booklet, his family described Benaud as 'a special person who means so much to each of us in many different ways.'

An airport luggage conveyor belt has a novel way of separating bags into the correct queues - but it's a somewhat cut and thrust job. As the suitcases whizz round on the belt, out of nowhere a mechanical arm slams into the bags and and thrusts them onto a lower track. The red and black luggage moves along the conveyor after being taken from the plane . Suddenly the mechanical arm springs into action giving the luggage some brute force . And with a sharp movement, the red and black case is passed down onto a lower conveyor belt . The mechanism appears to work on a sensor system, ensuring it strikes out at the centre of the luggage so as to not spin it, but what might shock is the force of the action. It is not known where this video was taken, although it is believed to be an international airport. However baggage pushers like this are used at airports all over the world, with Dutch company Vanderlande market leaders in the machinery. Their 'Parallel Pusher,' similar to the one in this video, is a widely used horizontal divert pusher that sorts single bags to one destination only. When the pusher is activated, a pusher plate operates at 90 degrees to the transport direction and pushes the bag into a destination or onto a connection conveyor. This suitcase is set for a ride on a different conveyor in a matter of seconds . The arm extends out to separate the luggage in the hope it arrives with its owner . The video, after being uploaded to YouTube, has been met with mixed responses.

Van Dijk, who scored Celtic's opener against Inverness, wants his side to bounce back and win the SPL title . And Van Dijk is now looking to wrap up the title in style to get over his Hampden disappointment. Celtic can reopen an eight-point lead over Aberdeen by winning at Dundee on Wednesday night ahead of the post-split fixtures. 'If we win the league we still improve from last year,' Van Dijk said. 'We want to win it as soon as possible and that starts on Wednesday. 'The disappointment is very high, everybody is down but we are professionals and we need to focus on Dundee. 'We need to move on. Wednesday night at Dundee is a big game, so we need to be ready for that.' Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths accused the match officials of robbing them a cup final appearance after they failed to spot his goal-bound header being stopped by the hand of Inverness defender Josh Meekings when the Hoops were leading 1-0. But Van Dijk refused to dwell on the blunder by referee Steven McLean and additional assistant Alan Muir, who was five yards away.

The England midfielder has interest from Liverpool with Brendan Rodgers keen to fill the vacuum created by Steven Gerrard’s departure. However, Milner is frustrated by reports suggesting that he has already outlined a move to Anfield. While City head into Sunday’s Manchester derby trailing neighbours United in the league for first time since November 2013, Milner is keen to ensure that City finish the season as strongly as possible. Manchester City midfielder James Milner will make a decision over his future at the end of the season . Milner, pictured after Manchester City's 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace, is weighing up his options . His present deal expires in June and his future has been clouded in uncertainty since contract negotiations reached deadlock in December. Only last month, manager Manuel Pellegrini described him as a 'phenomenon' and English football’s 'most complete player' in a clear attempt to persuade him to stay at the Etihad. 'Milner is a phenomenon, a guy with big balls and a heart this big,' said Pellegrini. 'I hope he stays. If he doesn’t, it will be because there’s an important offer [from elsewhere].' Milner though has made just 13 Premier League starts from 31 games - less than Jesus Navas, Yaya Toure, David Silva, Samir Nasri, Fernandinho and Fernando - and wants more regular football. Brendan Rodgers is keen for Milner, pictured in 2012, to help fill the void left by the outgoing Steven Gerrard . Liverpool began their pursuit of Milner almost 12 months ago and a move to Merseyside would tick many boxes. Milner would not have to uproot his young family from their home in Hale and would be offered the chance to play in his favoured central midfield position. As a free transfer, he will command a deal that matches or exceeds his current £120,000 a week salary at City. Arsenal and Everton have also expressed interest while Inter Milan, Roma and Valencia are also in the race for his signature. Milner will not make a firm choice though until after City’s final game of the campaign against Southampton for what could be the last major contract of his career.\",\n",

The 26-year-old Holland international midfielder played 72 minutes for the club's Under-21s and set up striker Adam Armstrong for the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory at Aston Villa on Monday evening. It was his second appearance for Peter Beardsley's side since recovering from surgery to repair a collapsed lung and while he admits he is still short of match fitness, he is in contention for a seat on the bench at St James' Park on Saturday if head coach John Carver requires him. Siem de Jong, pictured in Newcastle training last week, played 72 minutes for the U21s on Tuesday . De Jong has only made one league start this season but hopes to be involved in first-team again soon . De Jong told nufcTV: 'The plan always was to be part of that game, to be on the bench. I played 72, 73 minutes and hopefully I can be part of the team next week. 'We will see what happens. I don't think I could play 90 minutes yet, especially not on a level higher, so we will have to build it up and see how it goes.' De Jong, a £6million summer signing from Ajax, has made only three senior appearances and just a single league start for the club after first suffering a serious thigh injury and then being laid low by a recurrence of a lung problem. His battle for fitness has proved both gruelling and frustrating, and he is already looking forward to the start of the new campaign and launching his Magpies career in earnest. He said: 'It's getting a little bit better. I still feel that it just improves every day, but I still need to keep on improving. I feel it in the power training, but also on the field and in the game. 'I just need to get a few more games in, and I think that will hopefully be a couple of games his season, otherwise start again good next season from pre-season on.' The Dutchman was a £6m summer signing from Ajax but has struggled with injuries . De Jong was signed to help provide a link between midfield and attack and the kind of invention he provides has been sadly lacking for much of the campaign, particularly in recent weeks as a run of six successive league defeats has left Newcastle too close for comfort to the relegation zone. Victory - something they have not tasted since February 28 - over the Swans on Saturday would go a long way towards erasing any fears of being sucked into trouble, although with many fans in open rebellion over owner Mike Ashley's stewardship, it may do little to ease the tension on Tyneside.\",\n",

The only exception will be Sheik Joaan’s dual Arc winner Treve, who will continue to be partnered by veteran Thierry Jarnet. Benoist is the only jockey to have ridden Elie Lellouche-trained Ectot, who was unplaced for Al Shaqab in last year’s Arc having gone into the race one of the leading fancies having won the Prix Niel. Frankie Dettori is to concentrate on the British flat season and not being picked to ride in France . The recruitment of Benoist could be seen as a snub for Dettori, who was replaced by Jarnet on Treve in the build-up to her Arc success. But Herbert insisted it was no longer logistically feasible to have one jockey covering both countries because Sheik Joaan’s operation has expanded so much. Herbert said: ‘Last season it was feasible to keep travelling back and forth across the Channel but we have more horses this year – 80 in France and almost 100 in Britain. ‘It makes more sense to have a jockey based over there. Gregory Benoist is the rider signed up to race the\\xa0Al Shaqab banner in France this summer . ‘Frankie is happy with it and he will still ride British horses which we send to run in France. ‘The contract has literally been signed today. We have a very good relationship with Gregory. Thierry Jarnet will still ride Treve- there is no point breaking up a partnership that works.’ Dettori finished third on Al Shaqab’s Moheet in yesterday’s Novae Bloodstock Craven Stakes at Newmarket. The Richard Hannon-trained colt, which had won its only previous race at Salisbury last year, showed signs of inexperience in a tactical affair won by his Richard Hughes-ridden, front-running stablemate Kool Kompany. Hannon, who runs both Ivawood and Estidhkaar in tomorrow’s Greenham Stakes at Newbury, said both his Craven colts could run in the Guineas but, interestingly, Hughes hinted that either the German or French versions, both run around a bend as opposed to a straight course, might suit length and a quarter winner Kool Kompany best. Sheikh Joaan Al Thani (centre) chose not to go with Dettori and insists that he's happy with his choice . Most significant Guineas action possibly took place before racing started on the Rowley Mile when Charlie Hills-trained Acomb Stakes winner Connection put in a decent gallop under William Buick, who Hills hopes will ride his colt in the Classic back here on May 2. Retiring champion jump jockey AP McCoy was unplaced on his final ride at Cheltenham when Milan Bound finished seventh in the handicap hurdle won by Aqalim.

High-placed sources at Old Trafford have confirmed their interest in a player who is also being strongly pursued by fierce rivals Liverpool. The futures of Robin Van Persie and Radamel Falcao are uncertain and Van Gaal has put the 22-year-old Englishman on his list of targets. Danny Ings (right) is a top target for Manchester United and could be set for a summer move to Old Trafford . United have held talks with Burnley and through a loophole in Premier League regulations are able to agree a fee and pre-contract with the player to ensure a transfer in the summer. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers tried to sign the striker in January, but Burnley were intent on keeping him until the end of the campaign. Ings is out of contract in the summer but, due to his age, Burnley would be owed a fee set by a tribunal of around £5million if he joined an English club. However, under Premier League Rule U8 domestic clubs are able to agree terms with the club and player who would then move when their contract expires. Louis van Gaal is a fan of Ings and was impressed with the forwards performance against his side . Ings has become one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe. If United are successful they would beat former manager David Moyes, who is keen to bring the 22-year-old to Real Sociedad, to the signing. Tottenham and Manchester City are also interested. Ings has scored nine goals so far in his first season in the Premier League and United consider him to be a future England international. Van Gaal was particularly impressed by Ings’ performance against United at Old Trafford in February when he scored in Burnley’s 3-1 defeat.

An own goal by James Collins and Sergio Aguero's 20th Barclays Premier League strike of the season was enough to give City the three points. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates the players' performances at the Etihad Stadium. MANCHESTER CITY (4-2-3-1) JOE HART 6 -\\xa0The England goalkeeper couldn’t have wished for a quieter 28th birthday, and was rarely called into action by a toothless West Ham. PABLO ZABALETA\\xa06.5 – Treated for bloody nose early on but that was about the extent of the damage inflicted on City. Got forward well as usual. Manchester City right back Pablo Zabaleta keeps Enner Valencia at bay by putting in a crunching challenge . MARTIN DEMICHELIS\\xa06 – Careless slip let in Carlton Cole in the first half but otherwise looked relatively comfortable alongside a new defensive partner in Mangala. ELIAQUIM MANGALA 7 - Dominant display from City’s £32million defender who was able to enjoy a trouble-free return to the line-up, and snuffed out the few threats offered by the Hammers. ALEKSANDAR KOLAROV\\xa06.5 – Went close with slightly deflected freekick and another effort from a tight angle in the second half. Defensively, faced little threat from Valencia. FRANK LAMPARD\\xa06 – Only his fifth Premier League start for City and of lack match sharpness showed on occasions as his touch let him down. Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard was given a rare chance to impress by starting against West Ham . FERNANDO\\xa06.5 – Didn’t have too much on his plate but was alert to track Kouyate’s burst from midfield in the first half and produced a fantastic interception tackle. JESUS NAVAS\\xa08 – Much better from the little Spaniard. More direct and looked for an earlier pass, which contributed to both of City’s first two goals. Jesus Navas played a major role in Manchester City's two goals at the Etihad Stadium . YAYA TOURE\\xa07 – A more lively display than of late from the much-maligned Ivorian who passed the ball well and his interception started the move for City’s second goal. DAVID SILVA\\xa06.5 – Subdued display despite going close with a couple of efforts, and stretchered off following lengthy treatment after taking an elbow to the head from Kouyate. SERGIO AGUERO 7.5 – The Argentine’s third goal in two games took his total to 26 for the season, and the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 20. Can’t argue with that. Sergio Aguero celebrates with City team-mates Navas and Yaya Toure after putting his side 2-0 up . Manchester City ace Sergio Aguero wheels away in celebration after scoring his 20th Premier League goal . Subs: Caballero, Sagna, Boyata, Fernandinho (for Lampard 88), Nasri (for Silva 75, 6), Dzeko (for Aguero 90+1), Pozo. Scorers: Collins og 18, Aguero 36 . Booked: Navas, Silva . WEST HAM (4-1-4-1) ADRIAN\\xa06 – Had little chance with either of City’s goals, particularly Collins’s own-goal which looped over his head and in off the underside of the bar. CARL JENKINSON\\xa06 – One of West Ham’s better defenders and produced an excellent interception to deny Aguero an almost certain goal in the second half. JAMES COLLINS\\xa05 – Won’t enjoy seeing a replay of his freakish own-goal. Almost redeemed himself with a great block on Silva – but not quite. West Ham centre back James Collins diverted the ball past Adrian to give Manchester City an early lead . WINSTON REID 5.5 – Did his best to hold City at bay but guilty of an awful dive in the dying stages that was thankfully ignored by the referee and ridiculed by the City fans. AARON CRESSWELL 5.5 – After his goalscoring exploits against Stoke last weekend, had a difficult afternoon up against Navas and struggled to cope at times. ALEX SONG 5 – Had his hands full trying to screen West ham’s defence against the blue tide in the first half and replaced by Jarvis as Big Sam tried to salvage something in the second. Alex Song, pictured with Lampard, was replaced by manager Sam Allardyce in the 66th minute . CHEIKHOU KOUYATE 6 – His arm into Silva’s face was the talking point of a dull game. It seemed to be more careless than malicious but City may think otherwise. MARK NOBLE 5 – Overrun in midfield and was able to offer his team very little. Struggled tpo get into the game at all. STEWART DOWNING 4.5 – Lost the ball in the build-up to City’s second goal and that summed up his performance. Below-par and lacked any impact at all. ENNER VALENCIA 6 – Anonymous in the first half but picked up a bit after the interval and had West Ham’s best effort with a fine individual run and shot. CARLTON COLE 4.5 – Was gifted the Hammers’ best opportunity in the first half but took too long to get a shot off. Struggled with little service and replaced by Nolan. Carlton Cole failed to impress on his first start  since his side's 0-0 draw with Southampton in February . Subs: Nolan (for Cole 66, 6), Jarvis (for Song 66, 6), Nene, O’Brien, Amalfitano, Jaaskelainen, Burke. Booked: Kouyate, Downing . Referee: Anthony Taylor 6.5 . Star man: Jesus Navas .\",\n",

He wasn’t sharing his opinion as a former international, but as one who genuinely hoped his exile was about to come to a deserved end. Johnson — scorer of seven goals in as many matches for Sunderland —believed he was worthy of a recall, 21 months on from a five-minute cameo in Norway’s Ullevaal Stadium during a Euro 2012 warm-up friendly. Adam Johnson (right) was accompanied by his lawyer as he was charged with three counts of sexual activity with an underage girl and one of grooming . Johnson, an England international, was considered a prospect for Roy Hodgson as recently as a year ago . Johnson (right) was wearing a black tracksuit as he arrived at Peterlee police station on Thursday . At 26, was it plausible that Johnson had rediscovered the fearless form many suspected he had left behind on Teesside when he quit Middlesbrough — the club who had expertly nurtured him — for Manchester City in a £7million deal four years earlier? For at the Etihad, amid the millionaires and the silverware, Johnson may have become a richer man, but he emerged a poorer player. In February of last year, however, and on the eve of a Capital One Cup final against the club at which his career had stalled, Johnson spoke of playing his ‘best ever football’ and wasn’t joking when he revealed summer holiday plans were on hold in the hope of adding to his 12 caps in Brazil. Few argued. But Roy Hodgson was not aboard the ‘Johnson for England’ bandwagon. Johnson scored seven times in seven games during a run last season, and was still an England prospect . Johnson leaves the Peterlee police station after learning of the charges against him . Johnson leaves Peterlee police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity . The call never materialised and Sunderland — beaten by City at Wembley — finished the season fighting relegation, Johnson scoring just one goal in 16 matches as his form dipped. The eulogies which were written in the wake of his joyous January were, on reflection, a little premature. In fact, Johnson’s form has never recovered. Five goals from 31 appearances this season may well make him Sunderland’s top scorer, but that masks what have been subdued and often sluggish performances, even if he remains their likeliest match-winner. It is all a far cry from the skinny teenager who dared to dribble and made others dare to dream of the future which lay ahead. Debuting at 17 for Middlesbrough, he was billed as ‘the next Stewart Downing’. In 2005, that was high praise. He made a mockery of full backs and, indeed, those who had likened him to Downing, for it quickly became apparent that Johnson had the potential to be better than his Boro team-mate. Johnson has made three Premier League appearances under new boss Dick Advocaat (right) Ched Evans: Charged with rape in July 2011 but played for Sheffield United in September. Not released by club until end of the season. Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer: Not suspended by Leeds after charged with grievous bodily harm and affray in 2000. Jody Morris: Leeds suspended him for two weeks after the player arrested in connection with rape charge, October 2003. After six seasons at the Riverside, he was given the platform to prove as much. But at City, like so many young English talents, he regressed. There were concerns from within the club about his dedication and life away from football. His reputation, though, remained intact, such were the fleeting nature of his sightings in sky blue. To the outside observer, he was done an injustice by Roberto Mancini. And so Johnson was forgiven his uninspiring two-and-a-half years in Manchester when he signed for boyhood club Sunderland for £10million in the summer of 2012. Last year, he reflected on his time at City. ‘There is a temptation (to sign for them), of course. The wages, you’re flattered when City are after you, but you’ll go there and be third choice,’ he said. ‘When I was there, I was always the one who would be dropped when the manager rotated the team. I wouldn’t sign for them now if I was a young English player.’ The winger played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . Johnson has scored 20 goals for the Black Cats since signing for the club in 2012 . But perhaps Mancini was sound in his judgment. For although, during three seasons on Wearside, Johnson’s three goals in a trio of victories at North East rivals Newcastle have undoubtedly been the highlight, affording him terrace adulation, Sunderland had expected far more when they laid down an eight-figure sum and wages of £50,000 per week. Now, with Johnson having been charged with three counts of sexual activity with an underage girl and one of grooming, they are facing up to a relegation run-in perhaps without the man in whom they have invested so heavily, should the club decide to suspend him. The future of both Sunderland and their star player hang in the balance. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\",\n",

The actress and her fiance Ashton Kutcher responded to the impending lawsuit with a tongue-in-cheek video, claiming they were going to file a lawsuit against the accuser Kristina Karo, because of injuries suffered while being forced to watch her music video. On Wednesday the story broke that the 31-year-old was being sued for $5,000 by a woman claiming to be her former childhood friend, who said she suffered emotional trauma when a seven-year-old Kunis stole her pet foul. Fight fire with fire: Mila Kunis has responded to\\xa0Kristina Karo\\'s accusations she stole her chicken as a child, with a video claiming she will counter-sue for injuries sustained while watching Karo\\'s music video . But within hours Kutcher had posted a video - obtained by TMZ - pointing out some of the holes in Karo\\'s story. \\'Let\\'s just get this clear: you stole a chicken from a one-month-old child who spoke to you in an entire conversation,\\' the 37-year-old declares in the self-shot vid. \\'It\\'s just shocking to me. Not only did she have a conversation at one-month old in Ukraine, she was speaking English! This is the smartest girl I\\'ve ever heard of!\\' Kunis herself appears on the clip pointing out that it must be \\'just coincidental\\' he accuser has a new music video out, and is trying to launch a singing career here in LA. Foul play: The reason for Karo\\'s lawsuit 25 years after the \\'theft\\' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing \\'Doggie\\' for Karo and forced her back into therapy . \\'I was devastated. I was weeping. I was dumbfounded. I was like \"which chicken did I steal?\" because I was obviosly in the village when I stole these chickens. So I apologise to this woman who was maybe or maybe not a month old,\\' she said.

Kutcher pointed out in their response video that their accuser was also one-month old at the time and apparently fluent in English and Ukranian . Pollo loco: In her suit, Karo alleges that when \\'Doggie\\' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her \\'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm\\' (stock image) Karo had alleged that she was a classmate of Kunis, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were \\'inseparable\\'  growing up.

In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called \\'Doggie\\', TMZ reported. She alleges that when \\'Doggie\\' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her \\'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm\\', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has \\'brought back all the bad memories\\' and she now needs therapy again. She also claims the theft of \\'Doggie\\' 25 years ago has \\'prevented her from pursuing the American dream\\', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo\\'s self-penned online bio describes her as being \\'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia\\', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from\\xa0Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven. Wannabe: Kunis deduces it must be \\'just coincidence\\' Karo is trying to launch a music career just as she threatens with the lawsuit .',\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Bayern Munich cruised to a 6-1 victory against Champion's League rivals Porto last night. But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto . The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend . And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight . The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit . King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy . The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip…from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis\\xa0told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013 . A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one. 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.\",\n",

This weekend is arguably Saints' biggest match of their season, with former manager Mauricio Pochettino returning to St Mary's for the first time since leaving for Tottenham in the summer. Just a point and a place separate Koeman's men from Spurs in sixth, although this season's surprise success has brought with it speculation that players will exit much like last summer. Ronald Koeman held a meeting with Southampton's players to refocus their minds on European qualification . Victor Wanyama's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at move to Arsenal . Morgan Schneiderlin, Nathaniel Clyne and Jay Rodriguez have all been linked with a move away, while Wanyama was quoted on Thursday claiming Arsenal were interested in his services. The Kenyan denied making those comments in subsequently deleted Twitter posts - an incident which proved the catalyst to Koeman sitting his squad down on Thursday morning. 'I spoke to Victor this morning,' Koeman said. 'We had a meeting with all the players because what we need is now to really have the focus on the last five games. We play for a European position on the table. 'We have a massive game this Saturday and no interest in talking about rumours in the press about future and contracts and have the focus on the football side. 'That's difficult but it's not true what they put in the press and I believe the player. Koeman spoke to Wanyama and his other players to refocus them on the last five Premier League games . Morgan Schneiderlin has been linked with moves to Arsenal and Tottenham in another Saints firesale . 'It's a good signal for everybody that we have to be focused to the football side and not about the contracts. I do not answer any more questions about player's contracts and the focus on the last five games.' Koeman called the Wanyama story 'bulls***' in a separate interview and the midfielder later posted on Twitter to clarify the situation. 'Sorry - was caught off guard this morning about a story that I hadn't read,' he said. 'To put it straight: We all respect Arsenal but right now I'm only focussed on helping Saints to have a strong finish to the season. Manchester United are said to be interested in signing Southampton's English right back Nathaniel Clyne . 'The newspaper article does not say that I have spoken to Wenger or anyone else from Arsenal - and that's the truth. 'We are doing so well and what other managers think of me as a player is totally out of my control.' Wanyama is one of a number of players to have spoken about their future in recent months, with such comments becoming increasingly regular as the season comes to a close. A week does not go by without Koeman having to field questions about the future of his players and that is something he says has to stop. Jay Rodriguez is still not back from a year-long injury lay-off but he has been linked to Manchester City . 'It's not a lot about the players but in my case as well because I have always to answer questions about Schneiderlin, about Clyne, about the future of the players,' he said. 'I think now is the moment to really focus on what we have to do which is to win the games and not about future of players. 'If I keep going talking about future of players, it's easy for the players to do the same and we said together we need to be focused on the football side and we don't need to talk about the other side.'\",\n",

In footage shot from a dashboard camera on Sunday, the trucker lets rip after a car towing a caravan moves into his lane and the two vehicles collide. Eventually the car towing the caravan jackknifes, coming to rest across the front of the van, blocking the slip road - believed to be junction 8 with the M5, near Birmingham.

              " {'sequence': \"England had a good day on Tuesday at the start of this second Test in conditions that suited them. If they go on to bat themselves into a strong position, they can look at it in one of two ways. England can be happy they are good enough to take wickets at home and when the ball is swinging and conditions are in their favour - like here. If that’s the case then carry on as you are, but a position of strength is often a good one from which to take a long hard look at yourself and say ‘how can we improve?’ Alastair Cook needs something different to draw on in his same-same pace bowling attack . Cook is frustrated after dropping a catch off Marlon Samuel, who was on 32 and finished the day 94 not out . Cook and coach Peter Moores are under pressure to produce a result after drawing the first Test . The biggest reason England have not won away from home since 2012 is that they are lacking something different in their attack. The whole of England’s bowling psyche is about containment, it’s about bowling maidens and building pressure, as we saw for much of the first day here in Grenada until West Indies started to crack. That’s fine and it has been very successful for them but with so much batting depth now, with Jos Buttler arguably the best Test No 8 England have ever had, they can afford to pick someone who gives them an extra ingredient. There are those who feel it could have been provided here by Adil Rashid but by all accounts he hasn’t been bowling well enough to warrant selection. England have a good spinner in Moeen Ali - even though he looked rusty on day one - and a more than capable back-up in Joe Root. So perhaps that trump card could come in place of one of the four seamers who all have similar attributes. Leg-spinner Adil Rashid could offer what is needed but by all accounts he hasn’t been bowling well enough . Cook speaks with paceman Mark Wood, who could be what is needed with comparisons to Simon Jones . The one I would keep an eye on is Mark Wood. From what I’ve seen of him there is a bit of Simon Jones about him and the Welshman was a key element of England’s best attack of the last 20 years - the 2005 Ashes line-up. Jones learnt a lot of the skills that made him the 2005 trump card on the Caribbean tour a year earlier, for instance the ability to gain skiddy reverse swing on flat pitches, and Wood might have done that now. I don’t like building players up before they have played Test cricket and then quickly passing judgment on them when they are given their chance but Wood seems to have that different trajectory which should suit overseas pitches. He is the sort of bowler who almost takes the pitch out of the equation - like Jones and like Darren Gough and perhaps Craig White from my day. Moeen Ali is a good spinner for England, even though he looked rusty after being recalled for Grenada . Wood seems to have that different trajectory which should suit overseas pitches on which England struggle . In England we don’t produce enough of that sort of bowler and when we do get one we can hold them back a bit because they can be considered a luxury, or too much of a gamble. Look at the championship game which has just finished at Chelmsford between Essex and Kent. Wickets fell cheaply to medium-paced seam bowlers like David Masters, Jesse Ryder and Darren Stevens. Players like that will never have the attributes to take wickets overseas for England. A bowler like Tymal Mills, a left-armer with real pace who moved on from Essex to Sussex last winter, might. But will he be trusted to form part of a county attack in English conditions? Ben Stokes was the pick of the bowlers for me on day one because of the fuller length that he bowled. I was a bit surprised at how ‘back of a length’ he was in Antigua because I’ve seen him play in county cricket, bowl full and reverse it. He was definitely searching for that fuller length. Ben Stokes, the pick of England's bowlers on day one, athletically fields a shot from  his own bowling . Umpire Steve Davis reprimands England's Ben Stokes after he exchanged words with Marlon Samuels . Yes, at times England bowled a bit short. It might have been a case of coming from Antigua, where it was certainly not a ‘hit the top of off stump’ pitch, to here four days later where they found conditions conducive to bowling. I would have done exactly the same as Alastair Cook and bowled first and even though England were not quite at their best wickets started to tumble. Yet you have to remember that conditions and pitches change during the course of a Test — Antigua swung for three days and then didn’t for the last two — and sides have to aspire to a balanced attack. This England attack might be good enough for Grenada on a day like Tuesday but they must seek that little bit more.\",\n",

Prince Ali, who aims to replace  Sepp Blatter (right), warned against expanding the World Cup from 32 teams . Prince Ali is standing for FIFA president alongside former Portugal and Real Madrid player Luis Figo . He is standing against current president Sepp Blatter, Michael van Praag from Holland and former Portugal international Luis Figo. In terms of World Cup rotation, Prince Ali said the confederations should take turns hosting the tournament. 'The principle is that it should be rotated among the confederations but it still has to be based on the best bids,' he said. 'But we have to be open-minded. I think it is also possible that two countries from different confederations could co-host the World Cup. Look at Europe in 2020 - a number of different regions or countries could host the World Cup - it's in the past now but potentially the Gulf could have had a World Cup due to its close proximity.' FIFA has announced it will make a decision on the allocation of World Cup places at an executive committee meeting the day after the presidential election on May 29. Prince Ali said much more consultation was needed before any decision should be made. He added: 'I am very hesitant about people playing politics with the most important flagship event of FIFA and possibly of sport in the world. 'We need to speak to all the stakeholders, including the sponsors. People are making promises to enlarge the World Cup but in 2022 they are making the World Cup shorter in terms of time frame. We cannot end up with a situation where mistakes are made again.' Prince Ali has also promised greater transparency, including making public the salary of the FIFA president and executive committee members. He also believes that the minutes of FIFA executive committee meetings should be made public. He also wants an investigation into how the US television rights for the 2026 World Cup were awarded to Fox without a tender process or any discussion with the FIFA executive committee. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke has said FIFA 'did what it had to do' to prevent any possible legal action from the broadcaster in relation to the 2022 rights after the Qatar World Cup was moved to the winter. Prince Ali, who insists there is a real appetite for change among FIFA associations, said large sums of money for football had potentially been lost. 'Unfortunately I was not made aware of it and I have been trying to find out what is going on,' he said. Michael van Praag (right), from Holland, is the remaining presidential candidate . 'Something went wrong and we need to get to the bottom of it. 'It needs to have a proper tendering process which is good practice in any organisation in the world. 'We are talking about a large sum of money that future generations will potentially have lost because of decisions or misadministration taking place at the moment by people who will probably not be around at that time.'\",\n",

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Tottenham have won their last five PL meetings with Aston Villa, netting two or more goals in each game. Aston Villa have scored just six goals in their last 12 Premier League matches against Tottenham and never more than once in a game. Tottenham have gained 10 points from losing positions at home this season, more than any other side. Aston Villa have gained no points from losing positions away from home in the Premier League this season – the only team not to do so. White Hart Lane is the highest scoring stadium in the Premier League this season (51 goals). Aston Villa haven't won at Tottenham since 2008 when Ashley Young scored the winner in a 2-1 victory . White Hart Lane has also seen the most first half goals this season (27). Christian Benteke has scored seven goals in his last five Premier League appearances. Under Tim Sherwood, Benteke has scored at a rate of one goal every 87 minutes in the Premier League. Villa have conceded three goals in each of their last two Premier League games. They have only conceded three-plus goals in three successive games twice in PL history (in 2009 and 2012). Harry Kane has scored six goals in his last four Premier League games at White Hart Lane.\",\n",

The fact the football club aren’t doing so sends a very poor message. 'Most of the clubs put money ahead of morality and I think it is disgraceful because it just sends a message out to people that, actually, all they’re interested in is their results, all they’re interested in is winning.’ However, Jim Gilling, secretary of the Coxhoe Supporters’ Group, believes Johnson should be free to play. ‘It’s the right decision,’ he said. ‘We have to remember he is not guilty of anything yet. ‘But the club have left their decision open and it may well be that they reverse it should circumstances change.’ Manager Dick Advocaat supports the club’s stance and admits Johnson is ‘an important player’ as they fight relegation. But many fans are concerned that the decision has been taken on footballing grounds given the threat to their top-flight status. Steve Dean, secretary of the SAFC Liaison Group, told Sportsmail: ‘I am very surprised the club did not suspend him. ‘Going out of the Premier League would cost the club millions of pounds and that is often the first consideration these days.

He’s going to get hammered.’ Advocaat was not consulted over the issue. He will decide whether Johnson is in the right frame of mind to start on Saturday.

A Dan Potts header and Adam Drury's own goal gave West Ham a two-goal lead before Olivier Ntcham pulled back a goal for City, but it was not enough. Patrick Vieira's side were missing a number of players who were busy preparing for Monday night's FA Youth Cup final second leg against Chelsea, when they will be looking to overturn a 3-1 deficit at Stamford Bridge. Dan Potts scored the opener to set West Ham on their way before an own goal doubled their lead . Patrick Vieira witnessed his Manchester City Under 21s side lose to West Ham  at Upton Park on Friday . West Ham United: Spiegel, Knoyle, Page (c), Nasha (Mavila 80), Pask, Potts, Ward (Pike 72), Makasi, Brown, Diangana, Parfitt-Williams. Unused subs: Bogard, Westley, Hector-Ingram. Manchester City: Gunn, Drury, Oliver, Smith-Brown, Horsfield, Holland, Intima, Ntcham, Pozo, Glendon (c), Dilrosum (Nuttall 60). Unused subs: Tattum, O'Brien, Bullock, Fernandes. Under the Upton Park lights, the hosts took the lead inside just 11 minutes. A Djair Parfitt-Williams cross came in from the right and full back  Potts was the surprise recipient, popping up to head past Angus Gunn at the far post. City rallied and Potts proved his worth at the other end, clearing Jorge Intima's strike off the line following a corner. The visitors were in the ascendency going into half-time but within nine minutes of the restart West Ham had doubled their lead and this time it was a gift. Jordan Brown fired in a teasing cross and Drury could only stab into his own net in an attempt to clear. Olivier Ntcham, pictured playing against Roma earlier this season, pulled one back but it was in vain . City finally pulled one back with 14 minutes to go when Ntcham rounded goalkeeper Raphael Spiegel to half the deficit. Tom Holland and Jose Pozo both went close to levelling matters and substitute Fernandes shot wide when he maybe should have scored.

Regardless of the state of the wicket, Root was in superb touch on his way to 182 not out in the morning session, his second highest score and the fourth of his six hundreds to pass the 150 mark. But for the second match in a row England's hopes of pushing for victory were railroaded by a dead pitch that was arguably better for run-making than on day one. Joe Root hits another ball to the boundary on his way to an impressive big hundred in Grenada . Root admitted that the flat pitch made it too easy to score runs and too tough to take wickets . Root's efforts left the West Indies with a 165-run deficit, but they cleared that to finish 37 ahead on 202 for two at stumps. Speaking after the match, Root lifted the lid on the tourists' frustrations. 'These pitches are great for batters because we get big scores but as far as Test cricket is concerned, it's not ideal,' he said. 'Unfortunately, it's a very unresponsive pitch and it's been hard work . 'We all thought it might break up a little bit more and give a little bit more spin than it has done, but unfortunately it hasn't happened. 'This is what we've got to deal with, and we've just got to get on the best we can.' Stuart Broad, who eventually took the wicket of Darren Bravo, found the going tough in Grenada . Ben Stokes sees the ball disappear to the boundary once again as England struggled on day four . In all likelihood, the destiny of the game will be decided in the morning. England are five overs away from a new ball - which has been the only bankable way of making things happen - and must make it count with a cluster of wickets to set themselves for success. 'We're going to need a very good first hour in the morning,' he said. 'With the new ball we'll need a couple of early wickets and you never know. They're only 40 ahead, so if it's bang bang in the morning we've got a game on our hands. 'That would definitely give us the best chance of winning the game on a very flat wicket. 'Our only chance is wickets with the new ball, whether it be with seam or spin, that's the way it looks at the moment, but you never know.' Root admitted that England need early wickets with the new ball, just as James Anderson achieved on day four . West Indies go in to the final morning with Kraigg Brathwaite on 101 not out having compiled a dogged fourth Test ton and England's tormentor-in-chief Marlon Samuels alongside. Samuels, who memorably saluted Ben Stokes after his dismissal on the third evening, was not sledged when he arrived at the crease but Root had no guarantees that would continue. 'Everyone was very well behaved tonight, there was no-one speaking up,' he added. 'We'll see how tomorrow goes. Concentration might come into it, and maybe a bit of banter could spice things up a bit.'\",\n",

One source of salvation could yet come in the form of a three-point deduction for Rotherham when a Football League disciplinary commission rules on whether they fielded an ineligible player against Brighton on Easter Monday. But even that might not be enough. The result leaves Neil Harris’s side four points adrift of fourth-bottom Rotherham with two tough games remaining against promotion-chasing Derby and Wolves. Rotherham have a game in hand and a much better goal difference. Rudy Gestede (centre) scores the opening goal for Blackburn as he fires past the helpless David Forde . Goals certainly make a difference and, in Rudy Gestede and Jordan Rhodes, Blackburn have two players that Millwall simply do not. Gestede, scorer of a hat-trick against Nottingham Forest here on Saturday, took his tally for the season to 20 in the 78th minute, despatching a clinical right-foot shot into the top corner after Craig Conway’s cross found its way to him on the edge of the six-yard box. Rhodes is just behind on 19 goals after coming on as a substitute to make sure of victory, steering his shot past a stranded David Forde in the third minute of added time after the keeper had gone forward in the search for an equaliser. The big striker bagged goal number 20 for the season as he continues his excellent form for Rovers . BLACKBURN (4-4-2): Steele 7; Marshall 5.5, Spurr 6, Kilgallon 6.5 (Lenihan 37, 6.5), Olsson 6; Conway 8, Spearing 6, Evans 6.5, Taylor 6 (Cairney 71, 7); Brown 6 (Rhodes 71, 7), Gestede 6.5.

Subs: Archer, Hooiveld, Martin, Powell. Booked: Cowan-Hall . Referee: Nigel Miller . Star man: Craig Conway . In contrast, Millwall’s two leading scorers — Ricardo Fuller and Lee Gregory — have just six apiece. The failings in front of goal were all too apparent on Tuesday night. ‘Their two goalscorers have scored more than my whole squad,’ lamented Harris. ‘It’s clear to see why they won 2-0. ‘The team were excellent but we didn’t take our chances. Before tonight we had to win two games to stay in the division. We need six or seven points so my thoughts still haven’t changed.’ Millwall’s best chance fell to substitute Paris Cowan-Hall in the 68th minute. He was clean through on goal after Blackburn were caught out by Alan Dunne’s long ball forward, but goalkeeper Jason Steele rushed off his line to block. Rovers, who lost captain Matt Kilgallon to injury in the first half and had to play debutant Darragh Lenihan in central defence, had their fair share of chances, but it needed a touch of class to make the difference. Gestede and Rhodes provided it for Blackburn. Jordan Rhodes slots home the second in injury time to make Millwall's survival aspirations look impossible . Rhodes celebrated being named in the Football League team of the decade with the second goal . Neil Harris' side look almost condemned to relegation from the Championship with two games to still to play . Manager Gary Bowyer is realistic enough to know that they might not both be at Ewood next season. ‘I understand the business we’re in,’ he said. ‘Liverpool sold Luis Suarez and no doubt there will be people leaving bigger clubs than Blackburn Rovers in the summer.

              " {'sequence': \"Barcelona will play Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-finals, meaning Pep Guardiola will return to the Nou Camp. Guardiola, who spent four trophy-filled years at Barcelona, took over at Bayern in 2013. In the other semi-final, defending champion Real Madrid will face Juventus, with the Italian champions playing at home first. The four teams have combined to win the European Cup or Champions League 21 times, with 16 runner-up finishes, in the competition's 60-year history. The first legs will be played on May 5-6, with the return matches on May 12-13. The final will be played on June 6 at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. Here's how the draw unfolded... Host commentator . How about that, then? Pep Guardiola will return to the Nou Camp in the semi-finals with his Bayern Munich team. Many would have wanted this as the final. Personally, I think it's much better that Pep goes back to Catalunya rather than a final at a neutral venue. Real Madrid vs Juventus is the other tie. The possibility of an El Clasico final and a second straight all Spanish final on June 6 is still there. That's all from me this morning, though. Goodbye. BARCELONA vs BAYERN MUNICH . JUVENTUS vs REAL MADRID . Ties to be played on May 5/6 and May 12/13 . REAL MADRID . JUVENTUS . BAYERN MUNICH . BARCELONA . Napoli will play Dnipro and Sevilla will face Fiorentina in the semi-finals of the Europa League. That draw has just been made. Time for the main event, then. Don't blink... this will be quick. We're all ready for the draw to to start then. UEFA will make the Europa League semi-final draw first. Join me HERE for live coverage of that before the main event shortly after. It's been everything you'd expect from Barcelona really. They topped their group ahead of PSG before Christmas and have made light work of Manchester City and the French champions in the knockout rounds. Whatsmore, they are starting to look like the team to beat around Europe again and that front three of Messi, Suarez and Neymar are awesome. PSG are the team who knocked Chelsea out, but Barcelona dismantled them 5-1 in the quarter-finals. It was all plain sailing for Pep Guardiola's side, right up until their quarter-final tie with Porto that is. Bayern set off in their quest to regain the title they won at Wembley in 2013 by topping a tough Group E, which featured Manchester City, Roma and CSKA Moscow, with five wins out of six. They showed no signs of letting up in the last 16 as well, thrashing Shakhtar 7-0 at the Allianz Arena. But the last eight was a different story. Bayern fell to a shock 3-1 defeat in Porto in the first leg and needed something close to a miracle to go through. What they got was five goals in a sensational first half on their way to a 6-1 second leg victory. Today, they could be drawn against Real Madrid, as they were last year, or Pep Guardiola could return to the Nou Camp to take on Barcelona. Juventus are by far the least glamorous side left in this season's Champions League. They are well on their way to another Serie A title, and their European campaign this season has been just as efficient if a tad unspectacular. Juve finished second in Group A behind Atletico Madrid, just edging Olympiacos into third place. But their 5-1 aggregate thrashing of Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 went under the radar, as did their 1-0 win over Arsenal's conquerors Monaco in the previous round. Juventus are a team not used to losing many games, and will be a tough draw for either of the other three sides. It's been a season of two halves for Real Madrid, and their path to the last four of the Champions League is a perfect reflection of that. The 2014 winners were an unstoppable force before Christmas and won 22 games in a row in all competitions, including all six matches in a group that featured Liverpool, Basle and Ludogorets. It's been a different story in 2015, though, and their progress through the knock-out rounds has been far from convincing. In the last 16 they were made to hang on by Schalke, who inflicted a shock 4-3 defeat at the Bernabeu after Real cruised into a 2-0 lead in the away leg. In the last round, an 88th-minute strike from Javier Hernandez was all that separated them and local rivals Atletico Madrid. With the La Liga title race firmly in Barcelona's hands, Real will once again be looking to the Champions League for success this season. LAURIE WHITWELL: Sorry Pep, but Barcelona vs Real Madrid is the dream Champions League final . It's a pretty tough question to answer... so we picked the brains of our team of experts. As you can see, even our reporters can't even agree... OUR REPORTERS HAVE THEIR SAY ON WHO WILL WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . Plenty of build-up to this morning's draw on the front pages of the national press in both Spain and Italy. The feeling in Spain is that Juventus are the team to draw. AS have also listed the number of times each of these four teams have won the trophy - 21 cups between them from 37 finals. The Italian press seem to have a 'bring it on' message for Juventus. They also look forward to Fiorentina and Napoli in the Europa League draw a little later. Ahead of today's draw, our live football man Dan Ripley has compiled an ultimate lowdown on each of the four teams remaining in the draw. You've still got time, so why not have a read... As Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus meet in the Champions League semi-finals, Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on the final four . This morning, then, we will move one step closer to discovering our line-up for the final of this year's Champions League final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on June 6. The first leg of the semi-finals will take place on May 5/6 with the second leg a week later on May 12/13 and, regardless of today's draw, we should have some intriguing scenarios. Will Suarez have to face either Chiellini or Evra again? Will Pep come up against his former team? Will Bayern face Real Madrid as they did last year? Or will we have a home and away El Clasico tie to look forward to? All will be revealed, I guess. Good morning everybody. I'm sure you'll agree it's not a bad way to start a Friday by finding out the line-up for this year's semi-finals of the Champions League. There may be no English involvement, but don't let that get you down. Featured in this morning's draw in Nyon are four European powerhouses Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Juventus. The draw at UEFA's HQ in Switzerland will take place in around an hour from now, but we'll have plenty of build-up so don't move your mouse.\",\n",

Fellaini, who followed manager David Moyes to Old Trafford in the summer of 2013, is set for a more hostile reception than Juan Mata received at his old club Chelsea last weekend. The Belgium international became a symbol for the failure of the Moyes era but has turned his career around under Van Gaal and goes back to Merseyside as an established first-team player at United. Marouane Fellaini (second right) shares a joke with goalkeeper David de Gea during training on Friday . United are gearing up for a trip to Everton, and the game will be Fellaini\\'s first return to his former club . Louis van Gaal has spoken to Fellaini about keeping his cool on his first return to Goodison Park . Asked about suggestions at Everton that Fellaini has a short fuse, Van Gaal said: ‘I have spoken with Fellaini because I know this. Fellaini is always dry in his answers. He said \"it’s a game\". Yes, but it’s a special game for you. I hope the fans shall receive him like the Chelsea fans received Juan Mata because I like that very much. I hope it’s like that. ‘I am always communicating with my players about philosophy, performance, attitude, behaviour, and maybe one or two aspects more. \\'That is what I’m doing, not more than that. When players believe in you they want to convince me because every player playing for Manchester United has qualities. \\'Also Marouane Fellaini has qualities and we want to let his qualities dominate in the team and that is what we are trying to do. I believe that we are doing that. That’s why his performances are better just now.’ United have confirmed that Rafael has been ruled out of the remaining five games of the season with a rib injury, and Van Gaal expects to be without Michael Carrick, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind for the trip to Goodison after all four players missed the defeat at Chelsea.

Van Gaal insists that fellow Dutchman Van Persie (centre) must show his qualities in United\\'s second team . ‘All the players are still injured,’ he said. ‘Only Blind maybe, it’s a question mark, can reach the game against Everton. Jones, Carrick and Rojo cannot play against Everton.’ Robin van Persie is unlikely to regain his starting place despite playing for the Under 21s against Leicester earlier in the week. The Holland striker was an unused substitute at Stamford Bridge, and Van Gaal said: ‘He has to train very hard and play in the second team and show his qualities again. Then I have to compare him with the positions he can play with the players in that position. It’s always the same.’ Juan Mata looks on during United\\'s final training session ahead of their weekend trip to Merseyside .

United remain one point ahead of fourth-placed Manchester City in the race for Champions League places, and Van Gaal wants to finish in the top-three and avoid having to pre-qualify for the tournament this summer. ‘It’s better and your preparation for the new season is more easy. We set this goal because it was very difficult to reach the top four. We have discussed our goal with the board and the owners and they have set this goal. \\'I am the manager and I have to achieve, but they have set this goal for me to achieve.

Jose Mourinho’s side could face Sydney  at the ANZ Stadium on June 2 - days after Spurs’ fixture against the same side. The Blues are holding ongoing talks with Sydney bosses and, should they agree terms, are expected to fly out on the Wednesday after the Premier League season ends. Chelsea are set to follow Tottenham’s lead and take part in a post-season friendly Down Under in June . Manager Jose Mourinho has been discussing post-season plans with the Chelsea board . The concept of fulfilling commercial obligations straight after a Premier League campaign is appealing to clubs, giving them room to manoeuvre during pre-season. Chelsea are expected to arrive in Australia as top-flight champions and the 83,000-seater arena would almost certainly sell out. The plan for a post-season tour has been discussed for a while, with Mourinho saying earlier this month:\\xa0'If we win the title, I think we’ll go on an after-season tour, play a couple of matches in some destination where people will be very enthusiastic to have the Premier League champions. 'It’s something we are thinking about, a good way to celebrate. Not a victory parade but a trip, a week where we play a couple of matches but, at the same time, can be together without the pressure of winning every match, without the pressure and tension of the last weeks of the Premier League. Harry Kane's whereabouts in June is undecided, although it appears he will play for England Under 21s . May 27: Chelsea expected to fly out to Australia . May 28: Sydney FC vs Tottenham . June 2: Sydney FC vs Chelsea (TBC) June 7: Republic of Ireland vs England . June 11: Copa America begins . 'We can also relax and go to holidays with that good feeling. But we still have nine matches to play. [The chairman] Bruce Buck and the board are talking with me about destinations. We want to go somewhere where people are enthusiastic to have a club like Chelsea.' Tottenham play on May 28 and a week before England's friendly away in Ireland, meaning international stars could forgo the trips. The whereabouts of Harry Kane remains up in the air that week after the very public indications he will be selected by England Under 21 boss Gareth Southgate for the European Championships in Czech Republic. The timing does raise questions as to whether or not Chelsea's South American contingent will join them, with the Copa America due to start on June 11. Filipe Luis, Ramires, Oscar and Willian are all expected to be selected by Dunga's Brazil, with Colombia to pick Juan Cuadrado. Chelsea are set for a hectic summer schedule. They are also expected to travel to the USA for two weeks in mid-July as part of the International Champions Cup and be back at Wembley in time for the FA Community Shield on August 1, should they win the Premier League. Mourinho said on Friday: 'The players that go to a tournament like Copa America have a certain number of days to go. Friendlies have a certain number of hours to go. 'Players who play qualifiers for the Euros, they have another number of hours. We are going to respect that as we did all season. No problems, for sure. When our players have to be here, they will be. That's for sure.' Chelsea will face Sydney FC at the ANZ Stadium days after Tottenham play the same opposition . Manchester United had looked primed to join the growing list of clubs participating in post-season jaunts, but instead announced they are to play in America in July. Manager Louis van Gaal expressed his disappointment at last year’s gruelling schedule before that deal was ratified. Liverpool and Manchester City will play in Australia in July ahead of the 2015/16 campaign.\",\n",

That penalty shootout followed a 0-0 draw which saw AC Milan crowned European champions in the first all-Italian final. Now, after a long journey, Juve are back among the continent's elite. Another goalless draw, this time against Monaco on Wednesday night, was more successful for Turin's Old Lady as they reached the Champions League semi-finals with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona on the horizon. Gianluigi Buffon was celebrated reaching the Champions League semi-finals, 12 years after final heartbreak . Juventus' players salute their supporters after the final whistle in Monaco having made it to the last four . Juve have endured a tough few years but they are now back were they belong among the elite of Europe . The 12-year gap between now and that night at Old Trafford has been one of twists and turns: relegations, promotions, league titles, stripped league titles and European failure at the hands of relative minnows like Fulham and Bordeaux. Captain Gianluigi Buffon said on Wednesday: 'I thought I'd have to wait less when I was at this stage 12 years ago, but seeing the journey was very difficult, we can enjoy this result even more. 'We knew it was a great opportunity and after 12 years we wanted to honour the history of Juve.' Even this season, Bianconeri supporters thought they were as good as out of this tournament as early as late October. A shock defeat by Olympiacos in Athens had them on the brink of exit before they scrambled to a runner-up spot in Group A behind Atletico Madrid. Then Borussia Dortmund gave them a mighty scare in the last-16 before the narrow win over Monaco. Andriy Shevchenko sent Buffon the wrong way with the winning penalty in the Old Trafford final on 2003 . The Juventus players, including Alessandro Del Piero (centre) reflect on their defeat in the showpiece final . Back in 2010, Juventus were downed by Fulham in the Europa League, a side now in the Championship . Pajtim Kasami celebrates after leaving Juve on the brink of exit back in October, but they made it through . Looking back, their group-stage progression is not too dissimilar to the club's fortunes over the last decade. After finishing third in Serie A the season after the 2003 final, Juventus came back to win the league twice in a row - only to be stripped of them both amid Italy's match-fixing scandal that sent them into the second division. On promotion, they took four further years to reach the summit of Italy's top tier once again but piece-by-piece, the nation's most successful side has rebuilt. That hasn't come easy, particularly with their domestic division being overtaken by England's Barclays Premier League, Spain's La Liga and the German Bundesliga. Talent is hard to tempt to Italy - as shown by the failings of AC Milan, Inter Milan, Lazio and Roma. And when the talent does come, it is usually picked off by the big boys from abroad. The Italian champions were relegated to Serie B amid Italy's matchfixing scandal but soon rose back up . Juventus celebrate their second consecutive Serie A title last season, and they are on track for a fourth now . But not at Juventus. The side celebrating on the Stade Louis II pitch on Wednesday night included household names such as Buffon, Carlos Tevez and Arturo Vidal, while Paul Pogba - the most sought-after talent in Europe - is on his way back from injury. He could even be ready for the semi-finals, something any opponent would dread. They haven't conceded in their last three Champions League games - a hallmark of any great Italian side - and their comfortable domestic lead gives them all the time in the world to prepare for their final two or three matches in the competition. Buffon and Carlos Tevez hug on the pitch of the Stade Louis II, and they both have a point to prove . Arturo Vidal is one of the most sought-after midfielders in Europe but he has stuck with Juve until now . Paul Pogba could be back in time for their semi-final next month and will likely be a key player in any clash . Barca, Real and Bayern should beware: the oldest team left in it have a point to prove, and for some this could be their last shot at European glory. Tevez has been linked with a return to South America after nine years in Europe. Andrea Pirlo, Patrice Evra and Buffon are not far from the end of their careers, either. Combine that with the midfield prowess of Pogba and Claudio Marchisio, and the solid defence provided by Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci and they just might do it. Juve will be the team that everyone wants to draw but nobody will enjoy playing against. Roberto Pereyra, Andrea Pirlo, Tevez and  Fernando Llorente celebrate reaching Europe's final four . Pirlo, aged 35, might be facing his best chance of one last European title with the Bianconeri this season . Vidal had it about right after Wednesday's game when he said: 'I am not afraid of anyone. 'I think all four teams in the semi-finals have their qualities and on Friday we'll see who we face, but right now I think we're on a par with all of them. We play with our heads now and are a mature team, I'd say.' The European giants wearing the famous black and white stripes might finally have awoken.\",\n",

On Tuesday, SpaceX came incredibly close to landing its Falcon 9 rocket booster on a barge in the middle of the Atlantic. Now, leaked footage reveals just how close Elon Musk's firm came to success, with a close-up view of the daring attempt shot on a GoPro camera . A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster caused by a gust of wind. The video, which appeared on Reddit, reveals how the rocket overcompensates for its extreme tilt. A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve designed to control the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster. Earlier this week SpaceX has released its own dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the Atlantic. The video, taken from a plane , shows the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before exploding on impact. The maneuver was attempted following the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket a few minutes earlier from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Soon after the launch, billionaire SpaceX founder, Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.' The unverified video shows the rocket drifting into view in slow motion and floating onto its target before a gust of wind topples it over . Pictured is the moment of impact. \\xa0A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.'\\xa0This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough . Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. The autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft (90 by 30 metres), with wings that extend its width to 170ft (50 metres). Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. The Falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing and science experiments to the ISS - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts. The supplies today arrived at the ISS. The rocket was was due to take off on Monday, but the launch was  scrubbed due to bad weather. The video, taken from a plane on Tuesday, shows the the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side . On board the Dragon capsule was an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. 'We're very, very happy to have it here,' Cristoforetti radioed to mission controllers in Houston today. The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee-drinking in space. SpaceX, meanwhile, hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. The booster managed to land on the barge but Elon Musk said that 'excess lateral velocity' caused it to tip over . Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year . The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic ocean . Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions.' The Dragon — the only supply ship capable of returning items intact — will remain at the space station until around May 21. During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery of food and equipment arrived today . The launch sequence as it happened. All stages of the launch went to plan, except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket.\\xa0SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand . Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed second landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. This is the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit. The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying. The Falcon Heavy is expected to make its first test flight late this year. While the booster landing didn't go to plane, the launch was successful. It took place at 4.10 ET from Florida under perfect conditions, after a attempt had to be scrubbed on Monday due to lightning .\",\n",

'One thing I do wonder with Hazard is whether he has that hunger to score goals that you see in Ronaldo, Messi and [Luis] Suarez,' Scholes wrote in\\xa0The Independent. 'Those are players who have a ferocious appetite to put the ball in the net. They're unstoppable. Hazard seems to me to be a relatively gentle soul. One who is just as happy skipping past a couple of opponents and putting it on a plate for a team-mate. 'He does that very well, and I have no doubt he will deserve his accolade at the PFA awards. Playing the way he does, under pressure to score goals and make them, is not easy and he has been a big part of Chelsea's success. 'But in this modern age, if he wishes to challenge the achievements of Messi\\xa0and Ronaldo then he will have to prove that he can match their relentless desire to score goals.' Chelsea fans show their appreciation for the Belgium international at Stamford Bridge . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes (right) believes Hazard needs to be more ruthless . Nonetheless, Scholes says he would vote for Hazard as\\xa0PFA Player of the Year ahead of Tottenham striker Harry Kane - who has netted 30 goals in all competitions during his breakthrough season. Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho and Hazard's team-mate Diego Costa are also in the running. 'My vote would go to Hazard,' Scholes added. 'I prefer the attacking footballers – you wouldn't expect me to say otherwise – and Hazard has been the best in that regard. 'Not streets ahead of the likes of Harry Kane, and nothing like the wow-factor of those two big players at Barcelona and Real Madrid. But Hazard has made the difference in big games, like the one against Manchester United.'\",\n",

Rousey, the UFC’s bantamweight champion, appears in the latest movie in the franchise to be released on April 3 in the UK with her MMA skills used to full effect. She stepped out in a sleek black dress handmade by London designers House Of CB and a pair of Tania Spinelli heels for the event at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. UFC star Ronda Rousey poses in front of a fast car at the premiere of action film Fast & Furious 7 . The UFC bantamweight champion was all smiles at the Hollywood event at the\\xa0TCL Chinese Theatre . The look impressed Rousey's mother Dr AnnMaria, a former world judo champion who used to wake her daughter up with arm bar holds, as she posted an image saying: 'My little pumpkin grew up.' The premiere follows Rousey’s acclaimed debut WWE appearance in WrestleMania 31, in which she paired up with her Furious co-star The Rock for the event’s crescendo. Fans definitely liked what they saw when Rousey helped The Rock take down The Authority, otherwise known as WWE co-owner Stephanie McMahon and Triple H (real name Paul Levesque), and chanted her name at Monday’s WWE Raw. A Twitter post from Rousey in which she says, ‘We're just gettin' started’ alongside a picture of herself and The Rock giving their sternest looks, fuelled speculation this could become a regular deal. Rousey's MMA skills are used to full effect in the seventh film of the franchise out on April 3 in the UK . Rousey wore a sleek black dress and heels, but  managed a steely glare usually reserved for her opponents . Rousey is a massive WWE fan - she chose her nickname ‘Rowdy’ after and with the blessing of Canadian wrestler Roddy Piper and has been in the crowd many times. But this was her first time as an official participant and her arm bar on McMahon was only bettered by her throwing Triple H, at 6ft 4in and 265 pounds, over her shoulder like a rag doll. However, Rousey’s agent Brad Slater told Ariel Helwani on Fox Sports’ UFC Tonight on Wednesday that it was a one-off and that her focus is on her next UFC fight against Brazilian Bethe Correia in the headline bout for UFC 190. Rousey puts her game face on to take down WWE co-owner Stephanie McMahon at Wrestlemania 31 . Rousey throws Triple H over her shoulder and into the canvas as The Rock watches on . But not before she adds another film project to her resume. After featuring in an epic fight scene with Michelle Rodriguez which she describes as ‘a super oestrogen-pumped all-female fight scene’, Rousey will be the star of a new Peter Berg action release, Mile 22, which goes into production in April. Including Furious, Rousey has now appeared in three feature films after playing herself in the Entourage feature and alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone in The Expendables 3.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Tottenham are considering a state-of-the-art stadium with a retractable pitch that enables them to become the home of a new NFL London franchise. The bold design of the new £400million stadium, due to be completed for the start of the 2018-19 season, could involve a ‘slide-out’ grass football pitch with an NFL-style synthetic surface housed underneath. The option of extra-large changing rooms, to accommodate NFL squad sizes that can amount to as many as 70 players at a game, is also being explored by architects. Tottenham are considering sharing their new £400m stadium with an NFL franchise . A spokesman for the north London club did not rule out the possibility this week, confirming that they are ‘looking at options’ in order to ‘future-proof the design’. The NFL is said to be within five years of having a permanent franchise in London. Indeed officials will be testing logistics when they stage their three games at Wembley this autumn, with teams looking at how quickly they can have their players back in the USA and ready to play again. The clash between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25 will kick-off at 1.30pm while the New York Jets vs Miami Dolphins game on October 4 and Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs contest on November 1 will both begin at 2.30pm. As well as allowing the NFL to experiment with a live game on TV at breakfast time in the States (9.30am Eastern time), teams are able to take advantage of the time difference and be home on American soil by Sunday night. Tottenham's new state-of-the-art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018-19 season . Spurs' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the NFL than the 90,000-seat Wembley . If Tottenham press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the NFL franchise it would represent a significant blow to the FA, who also see the NFL as a potentially lucrative partner for Wembley, their £757m stadium. But the NFL are keeping their options open at this stage in the knowledge that a new London stadium designed with American football requirements in mind would be hugely advantageous. Even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new White Hart Lane is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which Wembley boasts. Wembley does have the iconic status that the NFL finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium. Not least the fact that they have to leave the lowest 5,000 seats empty so that the view of spectators is not restricted by the mass of huge bodies on the touchline. The modern NFL stadiums make sight-lines for spectators a priority and the new White Hart Lane could overcome the problem that is experienced at Wembley by having the artificial pitch at a significantly lower level beneath the moveable grass pitch. Wembley has hosted NFL regular-season matches since the International Series began in 2007 . Detroit Lions' clash with Atlanta Falcons kicked off early, as will all three games at Wembley later this year . Retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design. England have played on two: at Gelsenkirchen in Germany during the 2006 World Cup and in the Sapporo Dome in Japan four years earlier. The Gelredome in Holland also has a retractable pitch, as does the University of Phoenix Stadium that hosted this year’s Super Bowl. The advantage for these stadiums is the ability to grow the grass in a more natural environment, outside, away from the shadows of the stands while also having the capacity to stage different events without damaging the playing surface. A feat of modern engineering, a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours. A spokesman for Tottenham said: ‘The club has always seen the new stadium as being at the heart of the regeneration of the area and it is important, therefore, to look at how we future-proof the design, as well as increasing the functionality of the stadium, whilst being conscious of community uses. At this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more.’\",\n",

Denver Broncos cornerback\\xa0Aqib Talib and his brother are being investigated for aggravated assault after an altercation at a Dallas-area nightclub on Wednesday morning, according to reports. During a 2011 incident involving two guns when he playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Talib and his mother were accused of shooting a gun at his sister's live-in boyfriend in Garland, Texas. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother Yaqub are being investigated for aggravated assault . Talib was in trouble before and was wanted on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 2011 . During the latest incident, a shot was fired outside of Club Luxx in Dallas, Texas, after a physical fight inside . During the incident on Wednesday, Talib and his brother Yaqub had a physical altercation with someone inside Club Luxx and then a shot was fired outside around 2am,\\xa0WFAA reported. When Dallas officers responded to the active shooter call, the man who called police said three black men had been involved in a disturbance and one of them had tried to punch him. The man also said one of the men pulled out a gun and aimed it at him before firing a round off into the sky outside the bar and causing 'an immediate panic'. The Talibs left the area in a Range Rover and a Jaguar and went to the XTC Cabaret. Police found the brothers at the second club and impounded the vehicles to look for evidence. The brothers were both questioned and an investigation into the incident is ongoing. The general manager of Club Luxx, confirmed the Talibs were at the club but denied that anything with a gun transpired, the\\xa0Dallas Morning News reported. Hanney Kamal said: 'One-hundred percent that did not happen. 'I was there. Somebody might have called the police because there was a yelling argument. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract last year . 'It's athletes — someone sees them yelling and dials 911. 'Everyone was asked to leave the club, which they did of their own free will, and that was it.' Broncos vice president of public relations Patrick Smyth said: 'We have been in touch with Aqib regarding these reports and will continue to monitor this situation.' Dallas police falsely reported Talib had been arrested for throwing bottles last June during an NFL camp afterparty, the\\xa0Denver Post\\xa0reported. The police apologized after it ended up being Yaqub who was arrested. During the 2011 incident in Garland, felony warrants were issued for Talib and his mother Okolo Talib on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police suspected them both of firing shots from a Ruger .380 handgun at\\xa0Shannon Billings, the boyfriend of Talib's sister, and also believed the NFL back\\xa0attempted to pistol-whip Billings with a Springfield 9mm semiautomatic handgun during the incident, the Boston Globe\\xa0reported. They had apparently learned Billings was being physically abusive towards their family member. Talib, who owned both weapons. reportedly yelled during the pistol-whipping: 'You're going to make me throw away my career.' The charges were dropped because prosecutors believed Billings, a registered sex offender with the state of Texas, would not make a credible witness. Garland Police spokesman Joe Harn said: 'It was very fortunate no one was killed and no one was hurt seriously. 'There wasn't a great deal of distance from one person to the other that was shooting.' After the 2011 incident, a felony warrant was issued for  Okolo Talib for assault with a deadly weapon charge . In addition to playing for the Broncos, Talib has also played for the Patriots and the Buccaneers . In addition to the gun incidents, Talib was investigated after an alleged assault on a Florida cab driver. He then resisted arrest on charges of simple battery. The shutdown corner also fought with teammates and was suspended for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract with Denver in March 2014. He also has played for the New England Patriots during his seven-year career. During his time with the reigning Super Bowl champs, Talib said: 'I'm a competitor on the field, man. 'That's kind of what we're talking about right now, just football.' If charges are brought with regard to the incident in Dallas, Talib could face discipline under the NFL's personal conduct policy and a suspension seems possible given his history.

After stopping on track in each of the practice sessions on Friday due to technical issues, Button made it a hat-trick in qualifying for the Bahrain Grand Prix. After just three corners of the Bahrain International Circuit, the 35-year-old ground to a halt with what the team believe to be another electrical issue. Jenson Button was given a lift back to the pits on a motorcycle by a marshal after his engine failure . In first practice on Friday, the engine in Button's car cut out at the first corner of his opening quick lap due to an electrical failure, and then come FP2 a sensor issue forced him to pull over. Racing director Eric Boullier insists the problems are 'unrelated', and 'just glitches stopping the car'. The latest glitch, however, means Button will start the race 20th and last - his lowest grid slot since the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, when he was driving for current power-unit suppliers Honda. In contrast, and on the upside, team-mate Fernando Alonso managed to get a McLaren into Q2 for the first time this season and will start 14th. Describing his emotions, Button said: 'We're racing drivers and you want to drive your racing car as fast as you can. 'Obviously when you are limited to running in P1 and P2, with two stops on the circuit, it's tough. 'But given how things felt this weekend, in terms of driving the car this morning, it felt pretty good. Button jumps out of his McLaren\\xa0after failing to complete the qualifying session in Bahrain . 'I was quite happy with it. I ended up 11th. It's still only P3, but it was a good feeling. 'With Fernando in qualifying, our best qualifying getting into Q2, you have to look at the positives. 'You would say we're definitely making progress - we're improving every race we go to - but just a tough weekend on my side of the garage.' Alonso finished just four tenths of a second off reaching the top-10 shoot-out, but concedes he needs a helping hand if he is to finish in the points. The double world champion said: 'We're a little closer than any other race this year, but we have to keep our feet on the ground. Fernando Alonso managed to get a McLaren into Q2 for the first time this season . '(On Saturday) we were 14th fastest, so (on Sunday) if nothing happens we will be 14th fastest in the race probably. 'This is not enough to be in the points. We know our limitations are still there, so we will try to do our best. 'Races can change quickly. Some things can happen at the start, with pit stops, so we will take any opportunity we have. 'The main priority is to finish the race, hopefully with both cars, to learn as much as we can with this car. 'The position at the end will depend on many factors, and probably a little bit it depends on the others as well. 'If we want some points probably we need some help.'\",\n",

Stokes had given his wicket away just before the close of the third day when he smashed a Devendra Bishoo long-hop straight to deep square leg and Samuels wasted no time in pouring salt on his wounds, saluting him on his way. The Durham all-rounder muttered under his breath as he walked past Samuels before England closed on 373 for six, a lead of 74, thanks to an outstanding unbeaten 118 from the prolific Joe Root. Ben Stokes (left) gives Marlon Samuels a stare as the West Indian gives him a send-off salute on Thursday . Stokes looks at Samuels as the cheeky centurion stands at attention with his hat on his check for the  send-off . And West Indies great Curtly Ambrose, now the bowling coach, insisted afterwards that the eccentric Samuels was just having a bit of fun. ‘I didn’t really see it, but there’s nothing wrong with a little banter in international cricket,’ said Ambrose. ‘As long as it doesn’t go over the top I’m fine with it. I think it’s more friendly. He gave a salute? Is that a sign of respect, I don’t know. 'That's something that we don't really preach. We always make sure that we tell the guys to keep it clean, and keep it within a certain range, and don't go over the top. 'International cricket is hard, and they must find ways to relax themselves, and smiling is one of those things. As much as we're working hard and want to win, you must have some fun doing it. You've got to enjoy what you are doing. ‘I’m hoping it was light-hearted because we always make sure we tell the guys to keep it clean and don’t go over the top. I don’t think Marlon meant anything by it. You have to find ways to relax and have fun.’ The gesture was seen as good 'banter' by Geoffrey Boycott in commentary for BBC's Test Match Special. Boycott said: 'The Samuels salute was all right because it is banter and fun. It is not punishable — it was funny.' Stokes doesn't get a full piece of an innocuous delivery from Bishoo and skies his shot into the outfield . Stokes looks on in hope as the ball floats into the safe hands of Blackwood, who took his second catch .

Graeme Swann said immediately after the day's play that while not the biggest fan of Samuels the gesture made him laugh.

The 2010 champion rattled in an opening break of 133 as he reeled off the three frames required to turn a 7-2 lead into a 10-2 victory over Welshman Jamie Jones in Sheffield. Robertson has committed more hours to the game than ever before and he believes it will help him finally fulfil his potential and become a multiple winner of the sport's major crowns. Australia's Neil Robertson plays a shot during his  match against Wales's Jamie Jones at The Crucible . 'I have put in more hours for this tournament than any other in my whole career,' the 33-year-old Australian said. 'Before I played my first-round match I potted 300 balls without missing - that's the stuff (Stephen) Hendry used to do. Hendry used to not miss for six or seven frames, and that's what you have to do if you want to dominate matches. 'If you were to stop my career and look back, I would definitely have a feeling of 'what if I had practised more?'. I think I could do more so I've left no stone unturned coming into this tournament. 'It would be harsh to say I have under-achieved, but I think I could have won a lot more if I'd sacrificed a little bit more.' Barry Hawkins found himself the reluctant star of another Crucible epic after clinging on to beat qualifier Matthew Selt in a final-frame decider.

Robertson celebrates winning in his World Snooker Championship first round match against Wales's Jones . But Selt responded by reeling off five frames in a row - including back-to-back centuries - before a cool clearance from Hawkins saw him into the second round with a 10-9 win. Hawkins - who fought off a similar fightback from Dominic Dale in last year's quarter-finals, admitted: 'I can't keep putting myself through that. 'There's nothing worse than when someone is coming back at you like that and you can see your lead disappearing. Robertson contemplates a shot during his World Snooker Championship first round match at The Crucible . 'You're telling yourself it's only one frame but you can see him growing in confidence and potting long balls so it is a horrible place to be.' Ding Junhui's dismal record at the Crucible looked set to continue as he lost the first four frames of his first-round match against veteran Mark Davis.

Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation .

But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year.

It has been a difficult week for Rodgers, with the meek manner of last Sunday’s 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final ensuring his position has come under scrutiny like at no point during his three-year reign at the club. FSG, Liverpool’s owners, maintain Rodgers’ job is not even up for discussion but that has not stopped Jurgen Klopp – who will leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the campaign – being mentioned as a possible successor. Brendan Rodgers insists he is the man to guide Liverpool to success despite a disappointing season . The Liverpool manager is under pressure following the FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa last Sunday . But Rodgers has been boosted by the news that Jordan Henderson (left) has committed his future to the club . But Rodgers has not been rattled by the intensity of the criticism nor is he dwelling on the disappointment. He is concentrating on building Liverpool back up and wants the club to be \\'really forceful\\' when they embark on their summer recruitment drive. ‘After the weekend there is always emotion,’ said Rodgers, who will again be without Daniel Sturridge at West Brom and is \\'unsure\\' when he will return. ‘When you lose a big game this is when you find out you are at a big club because the critics come after you. ‘Three months ago, I was a tactical genius. Now I have lost a couple of games and it is not so good. ‘That is something you have to deal with. When I sit down and look at it, I will hold myself up against anyone to manage this club and to fit the model of what they (FSG) want. I am super ambitious in terms of wanting to win and there will be no greater place to do that than here. ‘Of course in modern football there are lots of processes that go on behind the scenes that people will never be aware of. In terms of what we are trying to do, I do not see anyone better in terms of the hand we were given. We are here to win. We do not want to be “nearly men”. ‘There is no-one more ambitious.

He now hopes Raheem Sterling will follow suit and commit to Liverpool’s future like him, Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho. Sterling, who told BT Sport criticism of his contract talks have been going \\'in one ear and out the other\\', will resume negotiations at the end of the season. ‘Raheem is a good friend of mine and he just has to do what he thinks is best,’ said Henderson. ‘But, if I was giving him advice, I would say: \"This is Liverpool\" – I think this is best place for him.

Two years since he stepped down as chairman of Rangers, the crackle of gunfire still reverberates in his ears. A declaration of peace in our time is premature. Dave King, the chairman-elect, has still to obtain the SFA clearance he needs for a seat in the boardroom. Details of how the club proposes to stabilise the finances have yet to come. And the Championship promotion play-offs threaten more landmines than the Somme. Yet before participating in the annual charity golf day of the John Hartson Foundation, the Rangers icon expressed hope that the worst is over. That Rangers can put down the circus tent and become a football club once more. (Left to right): Singer Steve McCrorie joins John Hartson and Walter Smith at a charity golf match . Former Rangers chairman and manager Smith hopes that the club can move on from its off-field dramas . 'I think it's a good thing for the club that it has settled down now and the EGM is out of the way and the people can get involved with running the football club,' said Smith. 'In the last three weeks there has been a lack of headlines and that's the first step forward for Rangers. 'The whole club faces a big, big period in its history. 'They have to get back to resembling Rangers Football Club. No club wins all the time and Rangers have had down periods before, even if this one is different. 'Everyone has to adjust to it. People on the outside, fans, everyone. 'There was a lack of trust before. It was simple. Now there isn't. 'They trust the people are there for Rangers — and that's a big start after three or four years of upset.' Smith exposed himself to the crossfire when he returned — against his instincts — as chairman. It is a decision he regrets and, despite the return to the club of familiar faces such as King and Paul Murray, he is 67 now and has no need to embroil himself in the grief or stress of it all a minute longer. Asked if he would offer help or assistance to the new regime, Smith said: 'I think they are unlikely to do that. I made my part quite clear — I don't think they will ask. There is a board there in place and they will make the decisions. 'I made mine when I left and I won't go back. 'They are not liable to ask me what course of action they will take.

Rangers' teenage striker Ryan Hardie scores his first goal agianst Dumbarton in the Scottish Championship . Hardie celebrates after scoring a brace during the Scottish Championship match against Dumbarton . Smith knows King from his second spell as manager. The South African businessman was a director of the oldco before administration and liquidation and, because he served on the board during the five years prior to an insolvency event, he breaches article 10 of the SFA rulebook. He may do so on two counts. As part of his settlement with the South African tax authorities, King agreed to pay £43.7million but was convicted of 41 breaches of section 75 of the SA Income Tax Act. In return for paying £210,000, he was spared 82 years in jail — two years on each count. The SFA are gathering evidence on this and until they pass judgment one way or the other, King has agreed to stay off the Rangers board. He doesn't have to be chairman or run the show to invest cash, but Smith believes it would be better if the two ran hand in hand. 'The courts seem to think he's OK,' said Smith on the issue. 'The SFA will give their own judgment on it. 'Dave has stepped in, so I don't see things changing in terms of how Rangers moves forward if he is officially or unofficially a part of it. 'It would obviously be better if he could be involved at the club — that would be better for everyone. 'I don't know all the background of what constitutes a fit-and- proper person. They have obviously got to show a bit of care with Rangers after what has gone on. I think that is what they are doing at the moment. 'I don't know what the outcome will be. I don't think it will make a massive difference to Rangers one way or the other. But the preferable aspect would be that he would be involved at the club.' Dumbarton's Garry Flemming (left) comes in with a strong challenge on Rangers' Darren McGregor (right) Rangers were never likely to be a quick fix. Promotion to the Premiership remains fraught with doubt and there are large question marks over who the manager will be next season and how much cash he may have to build a new squad.

'They have to build on what they are trying to do. It's just a start and people have to remember it. 'But patience and Rangers don't really go hand in hand and never have done. There is more understanding. I won't say patience. 'That goes for all aspects of the club, on and off the pitch. It takes time to clear things off the pitch, but the pressure is always on to win regardless of off-field circumstances. 'There is an understanding of what needs to be done to take a step forward. 'Stuart McCall has been bold enough to take the job and he'll stand by his results over that period. 'It is going to take time.

Burnley have only won six of their last 28 Premier League home matches (W6 D10 L12), but Spurs were one of their victims in a 4-2 win in May 2010. Tottenham haven’t lost back to back Premier League away games since March 2014. Tottenham and Burnley have already clashed at Turf Moor this season, with the clubs drawing 1-1 in the FA Cup.

Red is the overwhelming colour across the Football League in terms of the party that governs clubs' constituencies. The Conservatives trail some way behind, while the Liberal Democrats have only seven clubs in constituencies where they hold power. So if  May's vote goes the same way as the one in 2010, Labour would leave their rivals trailing in this alternative election. The Football League's political colours, based on the party holding each club's constituency . Ed Miliband (left) can claim that 18 of the 20 Premier League clubs are in Labour consituencies; but Prime Minister David Cameron may be concerned at the Conservatives' lack of Blues in the top flight . Football has long been hailed as the game the working man enjoys watching from the terraces . Overall, Ed Miliband’s party has MPs in constituencies housing 55 of the 92 clubs in England’s top four divisions. David Cameron’s Tories have 29. Only one club falls into independent hands: Bradford West, which holds Valley Parade, voted Respect leader George Galloway as their MP in a 2012 by-election. At the top table, 18 of the 20 Premier League grounds are in constituencies held by Labour. Only Chelsea, who voted Tory, fittingly blue, and Burnley, where Lib Dems hold sway, are any different. The research, undertaken by Philip Cowley, Professor of Parliamentary Government at Nottingham University, suggests football remains the working man’s game, so long as Labour is the working man’s party. Both Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Arsenal are all located in solid Labour seats. Kate Green, MP for Stretford and Urmston holding Old Trafford, has nearly a 9,000 majority, while Lucy Powell, MP for Manchester Central, the constituency housing the Etihad Stadium, has around a 10,000 majority. Liverpool Walton, encompassing Anfield, is represented by Steve Rotherham, who gained 20,000 more votes than anyone else at the 2010 general election. Steve Rotheram MP (left), of Liverpool Walton, the constituency that contains Liverpool and Raheem Sterling . Chelsea are one of just two Premier League clubs whose constituencies do not fall under Labour control. Greg Hands (right), Conservative MP for Hammersmith and Fulham, is the only Tory MP in a top-flight team's area . Kate Green (left), MP for Stretford and Urmston, which holds Manchester United's Old Trafford ground, where Wayne Rooney is captain of the Premier League's biggest and most successful football club . Five years ago Jeremy Corbyn won Islington North, where the Emirates Stadium is located, with a majority of 12,400. Chelsea and Fulham, holding both Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage, voted in Tory Greg Hands with a 16,700 majority. Birmingham Ladywood is the only other constituency home to two clubs, both Birmingham City and Aston Villa. The residents voted Labour by a 10,000 majority in 2010. Alexis Sanchez (left) is the brightest star at Arsenal. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn is the MP for Islington North . Lucy Powell (left), Labour MP for Manchester Central, can boast that Manchester City is in her constituency . Labour dominate urban areas, so their supremacy on football terms is to be expected. The Tories, with their traditional rural support, are not the natural choice of many living near grounds. Villa fan Cameron’s Whitney seat does not include Oxford United’s Kassam Stadium, for example. That is Labour. Nick Clegg’s Sheffield Hallam does not incorporate Wednesday or United either. They are Labour. Miliband is MP for Doncaster North, but the Keepmoat Stadium falls in Doncaster Central, a Labour stronghold nevertheless.\",\n",

Wilshere was on the bench against Reading at Wembley on Saturday after five months out through injury. And Parlour believes that the 23-year-old’s fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential. Jack Wilshere, on the bench next to Theo Walcott and Mathieu Flamini, for Arsenal's match against Reading . Wilshere, the England international, is pictured in training for Arsenal earlier this month . ‘I think he’s the future of the club,’ said Parlour. ‘I think if he stays fit, he’s a quality player, there’s no doubt about that. ‘The way he goes past players, the way he links up with people, I definitely think he’s got a big role to play. ‘But again, the big question mark is can he stay fit? Look at Abou Diaby. Diaby’s a terrific player. But look at him, the injuries the last few years. ‘The big burning question is can Wilshere have a full season without being injured for a long period, like he hasn’t had for the last three or four seasons.’ The 23-year-old pictured in action for Arsenal's Under-21s against Reading at the Emirates earlier in April . Wilshere is at the heart of a core of players at the Emirates which has now reached the FA Cup final for the second year in a row, and are approaching maturity as a group. And although the Premier League title may be out of their reach, Parlour believes that Arsene Wenger’s squad, with the right additions, could be ready to finally push for top honours again. ‘What I like about the squad is that they’ve got good youngsters - Oxlade-Chamberlain, Chambers and Bellerin - coming through, but the main nucleus of players are a good age,' added Parlour,\\xa0talking at the Carlsberg People’s Pundit final. ‘They’re not too old, they’re in their prime now, they’ve got the experience. So those sort of players, people like Ozil, Ramsey, Sanchez, Wilshere if he’s fit, they’ve got that nucleus. Ray Parlour, who won three championships with Arsenal, has backed Wilshere to be the future of the club . ‘It’ll need a couple of big signings, but if they can get them, I’m sure they’ll be a lot closer to Chelsea next season in the Premier League, and in the Champions League they can go the extra couple of rounds and get to the final,' said Parlour,\\xa0at the Boot Camp stage of The People's Pundit, championed by Carlsberg – the Official Beer of the England team and the Premier League. After months of scouring the country, The People's Pundit has narrowed down its search to five football fans in with a chance of winning their big break on talkSPORT on the last day of the Barclays Premier League season. Those five – a call centre worker, a personal trainer, a sales director, a production runner, and a furniture upholsterer – were put through their paces under the famous Wembley arch by punditry legends Jeff Stelling, Mark Saggers and Ray Parlour in the final race to see who will become The People's Pundit. Parlour, who won three FA Cups under Arsene Wenger, was also full of praise of the Gunners' FA Cup final opponents Aston Villa, and their boss Tim Sherwood. The former Tottenham boss – who grew up an Arsenal fan – has steered Villa away from the relegation dogfight and into their first Cup final for 15 years, and Parlour backed him to be named manager of the season if he triumphs at Wembley. Parlour won the FA Cup under Arsene Wenger three times, including in 2002 when he scored a stunning goal . Frenchman Diaby's promising career has been hit by a host of injuries . ‘I played with him at England, he always a great lad, always had a good football brain on him, and he’s certainly delivering the goods at the moment,’ said Parlour. ‘He’s certainly got something going for him, and I’d be amazed if Villa do go down, with the momentum they’ve got. ‘If he can keep the club up and lead them next season in the Premier League, and if he can win the FA Cup as well, it’s a great season. If they can come fourth from bottom this season, and win the cup, he’s got to be near enough for manager of the year.’ The Carlsberg Fan Squad is all about making football better for fans. That's why If Carlsberg did pundits, they'd probably be fans just like you.

It was an emphatic statement of intent: the German juggernaught is steaming towards the final in Berlin on June 6. The six goals smashed past the hapless Portuguese pretenders in the quarter-final second leg at the Allianz Arena now takes Bayern's goals total for the season to a spectacular and barely believable 115. And they're not done yet, not by a long way. Bayern still have five Bundesliga matches to play as they march towards a third consecutive title, the German Cup semi-final against Borussia Dortmund on April 28, and potentially three Champions League matches, should they reach the final. If Guardiola's goalscoring machine churns them out at their current rate of 2.61 per game, that would mean an eyewatering total of 141 goals for the season.

              " {'sequence': \"Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola weathered his first major crisis at the German club after his team crushed Porto 7-4 on aggregate on Tuesday to move into the Champions League last four. The Spaniard in his second season in charge was with his back to the wall after their surprise 3-1 first leg defeat in Portugal last week. Never had one of his teams lost before the semi-finals in the competition but that prospect suddenly seemed real. Bayern Munich celebrate in front of their delighted fans after overturning a first leg deficit to reach semi-finals . Thiago Alcantara jumps highest to head the home side in front on 14 minutes and set the Bayern on their way . Damned to succeed, Guardiola repeatedly said he was aware of what he needed to deliver at the five-time European champions for who a league and German Cup double was just not enough. He arrived at Bayern after their 2013 treble-winning season and expectations have not been lowered since. A semi-final exit last season only heightened pressure on Guardiola to deliver another treble this time round. But plagued by injuries in recent months and a rare internal strife after long-time team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt quit after 38 years, saying his medical team was blamed for the loss to Porto, Bayern had a far-from-perfect preparation. The doctor is hugely respected by Bayern players with many saying they would continue taking his advice and Guardiola suddenly in the firing line for allegedly falling out with a Bayern icon. Pep Guardiola said after the game that winning is a matter of life and death at Bayern . Robert Lewandowski made it three on 27 minutes as the Poland striker powerfully nodded the ball into the net . Failure to advance against Porto would have added to an already difficult week and would no doubt fan speculation about the coach's future in Munich despite having a contract to 2016. With Premier League clubs circling, a slip-up on Tuesday could prove decisive for both the club and the coach. But the Spaniard, who won 14 titles in his four seasons at Barcelona, thrived under adverse conditions with his team playing arguably their best game this season, even without injured Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba. Bayern frontman is congratulated by Mario Gotze (left), defender Rafinha (centre) and Thomas Muller . 'I felt it in the last few days that we would advance,' Guardiola said after Bayern fired five goals in 26 first-half minutes. 'This is about life or death and I know how very important it was,' he said. 'I know what is expected of me in this team. It is about winning just like at Barcelona.' Fans are now dreaming of a trophy on German soil in June's final in Berlin and with players gradually returning from injury, Guardiola is confident Bayern will further improve. 'We can play even better,' he said in what is no doubt a warning to other title contenders. 'After the loss in Porto the players were my heroes. Now it's easy to love them.'\",\n",

Should Pep Guardiola's side go all the way and claim this season's title as European champions, Alonso will become only the second player to win European football's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at Liverpool and Real Madrid. The only other player to have done so is AC Milan legend Clarence Seedorf, who lifted the famous piece of silverware for Ajax, Real Madrid and Milan. Xabi Alonso could become only the second player to win the Champions League with three different teams . Alonso in action during Bayern Munich's 3-1 Champions League quarter-final defeat against Porto last week . It is quite an achievement, and one that the Spanish maestro recently admitted to thinking about. 'There is one player who has won three Champions Leagues with three different clubs: [Clarence] Seedorf. Of course it is in my mind. The end of my career is near,' Alonso told\\xa0The Telegraph. 'I don't have many years left but it is one of the targets. It is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the Champions League is special,' he added. Alonso won the Champions League in his first season at Liverpool when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005. And last season he was part of Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the title, even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to sit in the stands for the final win over Atletico Madrid.

At 33 and with a club as strong as Bayern on a two-year deal under Pep Guardiola, Alonso could even attempt to match Seedorf's total achievement. Thiago Motta could also equal Seedorf's record if he manages to earn a Champions League medal with Paris Saint-Germain, but the 32-year-old midfielder has his work cut-out as the Ligue 1 side trail to a 3-1 aggregate scoreline against Barcelona. Names to have retired with two Champions League medals while at two different teams include the likes of Deco with Porto (2004) and Barcelona (2006) and former Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar who had been part of the 1995 Ajax squad before holding the trophy once again with the Red Devils.

When one of the team says Nascar, it means a glove change is to take place just like a motor sport pit stop, Roger says. 'When they say Nascar, that's a change of gloves. It's like being in a race. So he doesn't get cold, his body doesn't tighten up,' he said. On May 2, both Mayweather and Pacquiao have agreed to wear eight ounce gloves of their choice.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"It is a cold, spring night in the heart of Liverpool at a football ground bordering Huyton, where Steven Gerrard grew up, so Paul Scholes is in unfamiliar territory. But he is reluctant to leave. Most of the rest of his party have gone but he lingers as the final minutes are played out, with the score 0-0. It has been a frustrating night for Salford City, the club Scholes co-owns with former Manchester United team-mates Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt. A draw here at Prescot Cables means automatic promotion will become only an outside possibility. Gary Neville and Paul Scholes attending the Salford City game at home to Clitheroe Town on Saturday . (Left to right) Scholes, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs co-own the club with Gary Neville (not pictured) Salford are attacking the far end of the ground and the view is obscured but, with 90 seconds remaining, the ball breaks for substitute Gareth Seddon about 10 yards out with only the goalkeeper to beat. And even from Scholes’s long-distance view the ripple of net is immediately visible as the ball beats the keeper and Seddon turns away to celebrate. Scholes, too, punches the air, his face beaming as it once did when he scored a last-minute goal against Manchester City in April 2010. ‘We had to win,’ he says, a look of real relief in his eyes. This must compare to watching United in a title run-in. ‘It’s the same,’ he replies nonplussed, before reconsidering. ‘Tonight it has been worse.’ Seddon’s late goal set the wheels in motion for a fantastic run that has seen Salford win six on the bounce, their latest victory away at Burscough on Saturday. It takes them five points clear of Darlington, who have a game in hand, at the top of the Evo-Stik League First Division North (four tiers below the Football League). With one week to go promotion is well and truly in their hands. Win at home to Ossett Town on Saturday and they are up. Remarkably, Salford City are the team who have happened upon five of the biggest names in English football as owners. The former United players, otherwise known as the Class of ’92, are products of the Premier League era which has propelled the game into a celebrity culture. Here, though, they seem in their element and none more so than Scholes. Earlier Phil Neville was with him. ‘This is going to ruin my week, this is,’ he mutters as another chance is wasted. This is near the base of the football pyramid: clearly the players are a lot better than Sunday League footballers but the culture is closer to Hackney Marshes than Old Trafford. Scholes sits in one corner with a friend, while Phil Neville, across the table with his father, Neville, informs him that they will be pairing up with One Direction at a forthcoming Pro-Am Golf Day so Scholes might need a stylist to keep up appearances. Scholes pulls a face while the rest of the group laughs at his expense. Meanwhile, the Prescot committee members quietly discuss a promising first half. The Salford owners are scarcely given a second glance, though there is the occasional photo to pose for. A queue of fans wait for food duing the Evo-Stick League Northern Premier match . Jimmy Birtwhistle, pictured with his grandsons, is a committee member and has looked after the turnstile for the past six years . Although yesterday’s 2-1 win at Burscough extended Salford’s lead at the top, the season has been anything but a smooth ride. The original manager Phil Power was sacked in January and left complaining that the decision was delivered by chairman Karen Baird, with the owners failing to contact him. Both Gary and Phil Neville say they did contact him to talk through their reasons but the offer was refused. ‘That was a low moment and not something we want to do often because there are good people at this level and you don’t want them to lose their job,’ said Phil Neville. ‘This season has been a massive learning curve. The biggest lesson we have learnt is we have to take a step away from the playing and coaching side. Let the managers manage and players play. At this level, they are the experts, not us.’ The club are now managed by the duo of Anthony Johnson and Bernard Morley, who won promotion from this league last season with Ramsbottom United. When Power was in charge, Scholes and Phil Neville attended training and helped out with sessions but, under the new managers, that has come to an end. ‘We had become the meddling owners, everything we didn’t want to be,’ said Phil Neville. Gary Neville takes up the story. ‘Phil and Paul became quite involved in the first three or four months and we found that what might have been seen as a positive didn’t work out that way,’ he said. ‘The players would hear different voices — one week they would be there, the next they’re not there. With coaching, it’s about consistency and repetition. What was seen as being assistance for the previous manager and creating a buzz just didn’t work. ‘The sadness of it all is that we did lose a manager and it was not something we wanted to do. It was not something that we felt good about.’ There have been other adjustments to the non-League level. ‘You never win away games at night in midweek,’ said Phil Neville. ‘Players are tired after a day’s work; often they’ve rushed to the ground sometimes without eating properly; naturally they fade late on.’ Former Manchester United striker Danny Webber now plays for Salford City . Salford City's game against Clitheroe Town on Saturday was free admission for fans . Captain Christopher Lynch works a night shift loading gas bottles, physically demanding work, and usually has to come off after 70 minutes in evening games to go to work. The owners have tried to address the fatigue problem, with the team meeting in a hotel for salad, pasta, chicken and salmon a few hours before their matches. ‘At the start of the season we had a perfect vision that we’ll have the manager now for the next 20 years and we’ll have a set of young players and they’ll see us all the way to the Football League,’ said Phil Neville. ‘But as time has gone on, we’ve learnt from speaking to teams that have come through the divisions, like Fleetwood, Fylde and AFC Wimbledon, that you have to be ruthless.’ If there has been a loss of innocence, there is at least a better understanding of an owner’s lot. ‘You can understand how, when emotions are running high, owners can make bad emotional decisions like bringing players in on big money and putting yourself under financial pressure,’ said Phil Neville. ‘I can see how it runs away with you. When you lose a couple of games you think: “Oh, we need a new player. Let’s just push the budget out a little bit and we’ll make it back here.” But you never make it back.’ LEFT TO RIGHT TOP ROW - Phil Neville, Robbie, Savage, Raimond Van Der Gouw, John O'Kane, Mikael Silvestre, Quinton Fortune . LEFT TO RIGHT BOTTOM ROW - Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Raphael Burke, Ryan Giggs Paul Scholes line up for a Class of '92 v Salford City match last August . Gary Neville added: ‘When we jumped into this we thought this is going to be a big challenge and a lot of people are going to be looking at how this goes. But actually, no matter what happens, if we’re still watching this level of football in five years’ time, we’ll be disappointed because we won’t have progressed, but we’ll still be happy every week. ‘It brings us back down to earth.We might be coaching with England or United or doing a Premier League game or Champions League game in Barcelona. Then three days later you’re at Brighouse away or Ossett Town and there’s a tea lady at half-time saying: “Do you want a cup of tea, love?” It’s just real. People at this level do it for the passion of their clubs and their communities. And though Giggs and Butt haven’t been able to attend as much, because of their coaching duties at Manchester United, Scholes and Phil Neviile clearly feel the same. ‘At the start we asked ourselves why we were doing it,’ said Phil Neville. ‘But when you come down to training, go to matches and mix with the supporters, it just feels real. ‘There’s a simplicity at this level. It’s exciting to watch. I know we want the game to be played in a beautiful way but there is also something beautiful about the style at this level. The roots of English football are actually in the Evo-Stik League.’\",\n",

The Italian was at Griffin Park on Saturday for the draw against Bolton and spoke with Bees owner Matthew Benham. Current boss Mark Warburton is to leave the club next month after feeling his vision did not match that of Brentford, who are to implement a continental approach to their management structure. Brentford are considering Gianfranco Zola to replace Mark Warburton at the club when he leaves this summer . The Italian was manager of Watford for a little over a season beginning in 2012, and led them to the play-offs . Zola is best remembered for the seven years he spent at Chelsea, where he scored 59 Premier League goals . Zola is one of a number of candidates on the list to replace Warburton, with Benham also sounding out coaches from Spain and France. The owner wants to follow the lead of his Danish side FC Midtjylland, who are on the cusp of winning the Superliga, sitting 11 points clear at the top. In keeping with Benham’s want for mathematical modelling, Zola would need to agree to having a statistics man alongside him should talks go well. Warburton is leaving Brentford this summer because his vision for the club did not match the owners' Rayo Vallecano’s Paco Jemez was the initial favourite to land the job. Brentford could still win promotion to the Premier League in the coming weeks but have fallen three points beneath the play-offs with two games remaining. Zola was sacked by Cagliari last month after failing to win a game during his three-month stint in charge. They are primed to drop out of Serie A alongside Parma. But the former Watford head coach does have extensive experience of managing in England and would buy into the European way to start in west London. He also enjoyed a largely successful spell at West Ham for two years from 2008. Zola was sacked by relegation-threatened Cagliari last month after a winless spell in Serie A .

              " {'sequence': \"Two goals within ninety seconds of each other was enough to spark an outbreak of fear and loathing rarely seen on this side of the Mersey. After more than two years of inexorable decline the patience of Tranmere's faithful finally snapped when Oxford moved decisively ahead, in an effortless manner reminiscent of the previous Saturday's Boat Race. The loathing was directed mainly at manager Micky Adams, who was announced on Sunday morning to have left the club by 'mutual consent'. The Tranmere players look down after the final whistle, as the prospect of relegation looms large . This is how it ends in football sometimes: standing in the dugout having a season ticket thrown in your face by an incandescent supporter, who you then see given a standing ovation by some sections upon being escorted out. The fear involves dropping out of the Football League a week on Saturday after 94 years of membership, something which provoked an angry demonstration by some 150 supporters outside the gates afterwards. Adams departs with two games to go and after a 3-0 defeat against a thoroughly professional Oxford side the Wirral's only professional sports outfit are one point behind Cheltenham and two behind Hartlepool. Bitter ironies abound. Relegation to the National League – the grand-sounding new title for the Conference but don't be fooled – may partly be down to Prenton Park legend and ex-manager Ronnie Moore, sacked by the club last season for a minor betting offence, and now masterminding Hartlepool's unlikely survival. And it could all happen under the ownership of former FA Chief Executive Mark Palios, knowledgeable football man and esteemed former Tranmere player who took over the club late last summer. Kemar Roofe celebrates scoring, as a professional Oxford side eased past sorry Tranmere . The battle between Barnet and Bristol Rovers to win automatic promotion to the Football League will go down to the last game. Barnet, who lead the Conference by one point, have a home game against mid-table Gateshead on Saturday while Rovers face a potentially more difficult match at home against fourth from bottom Alfreton, who almost certainly need to win themselves to avoid being relegated. Rovers looked as if they would head the table after the weekend’s games but conceded a goal with two minutes left to draw 1-1 at Dover. That put Barnet, who dropped out of the Football League two seasons ago, in the driving seat after a 1-1 draw away to Kidderminster. Grimsby are guaranteed a play-off spot, but one of Eastleigh, Forest Green and Macclesfield will miss out. It all seemed such a good idea at the time. Nobody questioned his judgement in October when, with the team bottom of the table, he replaced the inexperienced Rob Edwards with a seasoned operator like Adams. There was the odd dead cat bounce, but six months on they are still bottom after failing to keep a clean sheet for nineteen consecutive matches. The Mersey ferry displays a quicker turning circle than that shown by the home defence for the two killer goals that came just after half-time, but then a cause of that may be a lack of familiarity among players. A staggering 52 have been called up to first team duty this season. Adams played the selection and recruitment game like a man on the fruit machine, continually pulling the handle in the hope that the right combination would come up in alignment. The latest loan signing has been young Everton winger George Green who, when pulled off on Saturday after 60 minutes, could be seen haranguing some of his team-mates on the bench. It was not long after full-time that you could catch assistant manager Alan Rogers, part of a distinguished list of former Tranmere players who graduated to a higher level, stripping the paint from the dressing room walls. Micky Adams has left the club by mutual consent, with Tranmere bottom of the league with two games to go . Rogers – now in charge for the next fortnight – then had to deny that Adams's decision to dodge the media was of any significance. He then professed himself 'dumbfounded' by the team's performance. And so it unravels in desperate times. They had actually competed gamely in the first half, but were overwhelmed by anxiety when getting anywhere near the goal. 'It's not acceptable,' he said. 'We just don't look like scoring a goal. The players have got to start taking some responsibility. It's an easy option pointing fingers at the manager but the players have got to look at themselves, have they done enough? The answer is no. I was a player. You've got to stand up and be counted.' Marc Laird, well-travelled journeyman and among those fighting for his career, did not try to shift the blame onto the management. He just about summed up the sense of disbelief saying: 'It's a big club, when I joined in the summer I never imagined that we would be where we are.' The prospect of dropping out of the 92 is something uniquely grim in English football, especially for a club of this heritage, who shortly after joining the league gave a debut to 16 year-old local lad Dixie Dean. It was only in January 2013 that they stood on top of League One and early in the last decade reached the League Cup final plus three FA Cup sixth rounds. But they do not have to look far for examples of how there is no easy road back in the event of relegation. Aside from Southport and Chester there is Wrexham, not far across the Welsh border and a decent sized club, who fell out of the league in 2008 and have yet to return. There is a long trip to Plymouth next Saturday and then a last home game against Bury. The unpalatable odds are that the next stop after that could be somewhere like Braintree or Dover.\",\n",

The group on the boat cheer and yell in excitement at what they are witnessing as the whales appear to start moving closer to the boat. According to Steven, the group believe that the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the pod to them, as its distinctive sound disturbed the whales. Commenting on their approach, one of the group can be heard saying: ‘They’re probably coming to check us out.’ The group believe that the sound of the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the orcas . One of the group states that the orca is probably coming to check them out before it emerges from the water and gives them all a fright . Before later adding: ‘That is like 50 yards from us,’ as the marine mammals continue to head in the direction of their boat. After suggesting that it might be a good idea to start rowing away, one of the group begins panicking and shouts: ‘Guys we need to get out of here, it’s coming right at us.’ He then states: ‘We need to sit down in the boat.

It has emerged that Keith Pelley, the Canadian media mogul chosen as chief executive of golf's European Tour, was not the only non-European in the running.

The message seems to have been that the Tour didn't want to antagonise the rest of Europe by appointing another Brit following the long, successful reigns of Ken Schofield and George O'Grady.

Of course Chelsea could implode and hand the title to Arsenal over the next six weeks or so, but that’s unlikely. If it does happen it’s a title that’s long overdue and nothing can ever take away the barren years when Arsenal and Arsene Wenger were an embarrassment at home and abroad – specialists in failure. Those years will always hang heavy around Wenger’s neck. Yes, yes, there’s the FA Cup currently sitting there in the trophy cabinet alongside the shiny shield they won in August. And yes, yes, they are clear favourites to win it again. An FA Cup isn’t the definition of success for the great clubs of Europe. Only the Wenger apologists can’t see that. Olivier Giroud celebrates Arsenal's third goal by Alexis Sanchez in their win over Liverpool on Saturday . Arsene Wenger's Gunners now have 15 wins from 17 games since New Year's Day, but it's come too late . So are Gooners seduced by this end of season run they’re currently on? It’s impressive, no question. 15 wins in 17 games since their loss New Year’s Day. But this is classic Arsene Wenger isn’t it? After that defeat at Southampton on January 1 the Gunners were sixth in the table, 13 points behind leaders Chelsea. Wenger and the players felt they had no hope of winning the title, and so they started to play with freedom, and the wins kept coming. As soon as the pressure is off, Arsene Wenger looks like he can still do it. But once the pressure is on he crumbles, and his players lose their bottle completely. Sanchez drills his shot by Emre Can as Arsenal's impressive run continued against Liverpool . Per Mertesacker can't stop this shot from Sadio Mane as they fall 2-0 to Southampton on New Year's Day . The only two defeats in this current run were the two key games all Arsenal fans desperately wanted to win – at Tottenham and at home to Monaco in the Champions League: the two games with more pressure on them than any others on this run. They went to Monaco for the second leg with no pressure on them, everyone thought they were out, and so it proved. But with the pressure off, Arsenal turned it on. Arsenal are clearly a lot better than most of the teams they face. And they are now making the kind of signings they should be making – marquee players. So much is in place for real success to come. But the task for Wenger now is to show some balls, cope better when the pressure is on. And he and his players need to stop failing in certain games. Harry Kane celebrates his second strike in the 2-1 win for Tottenham over their North London rivals . Dimitar Berbatov scores the second of three away goals for Monaco that ruined Arsenal's Europe campaign . Dodgy results will happen to all sides of course. But I’m talking about the ones that should have been avoided. This season for example, if they’d won a game they were winning at Swansea, if they hadn’t been so desperately pathetic in the first half at Stoke, and if they’d kept the lead at 10-man Liverpool, Arsenal would be top. Those games and the circumstances of how they dropped points, have stopped Arsenal being serious title contenders this season. When you analyse it like that, you can understand the frustrations of the Arsenal fans after that Stoke defeat in December. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain slumps to the ground as Arsenal bow out of the Champions League last 16 . Aaron Ramsey scores in the Gunners' 2-0 win at Monaco as they fell short again when it really counts . Arsene Wenger has been given time to fail repeatedly, and he’s still there. He now needs to make the most of his incredible good fortune and start earning his £8m a year as the fourth-highest-paid football manager in the world. Winning games when the pressure is off is something Wenger has proved he can do regularly. Now he needs to learn how to cope and succeed when the pressure is on. If he does that, then there really is no reason why Arsenal can’t win a major trophy, the kind of trophy that defines success for big clubs, and end an embarrassing period of failure for Arsene Wenger.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"One of the less celebrated aspects of Richie Benaud’s remarkable career were his regular appearances in that part of the press box which houses the written journalists. Benaud was first and foremost a television broadcaster, a man of unusually wry wit who once responded on air to colleague Chris Broad’s malapropism (‘Honestly, you run out of expletives when describing the fielding of Jonty Rhodes’) without skipping a beat: ‘Which particular one did you have in mind?’ But Benaud also penned a regular column for the News of the World, taking his place among the hacks – not all TV men take the trouble – to craft his copy whenever a Test match was going on. Richie Benaud, pictured  in January 2013, has died \\xa0at the age of 84 after a battle with skin cancer . Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Tributes are seen at the statue of Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing . It was said he would regularly file 700 or 800 words, of which maybe 150 or 200 would see the light of day. But, a professional to his core, Benaud kept on filing. He loved cricket, and he loved conveying his love, by visual means or verbal. That much was evident during his playing days. He won 63 Test caps between January 1952 and February 1964, collecting 248 wickets with his leg-spin (at a very good average of 27) and scoring 2,201 runs at 24. But it was the style as much as the stats. It was often an understated era, typified by Jim Laker’s steadfast refusal to celebrate any of the 19 wickets he took against Australia at Old Trafford in 1956 (Benaud c Statham b Laker 0; Benaud b Laker 18). Benaud did his best to change all that. Sport was fun, emotional and human: if he got a wicket, he’d do more than hitch his trousers up, Laker-style. He’d whoop and skip and jump: take a look on YouTube at him enjoying Bob Simpson’s slip catch at Old Trafford in 1961, where his leg-breaks spirited Australia to a come-from-behind win. These days players go further than that. But Benaud was their spiritual forefather. He loved not just cricket, but cricketers too. Not everyone was enamoured by his involvement in Kerry Packer’s rebellious World Series Cricket in the late 1970s. But WSC eventually forced the Establishment’s hand. Cricketers were soon paid a living wage, not the honorariums they had previously endured. Benaud’s involvement and influence were central to that. It was as a TV commentator that Benaud came into his own. When Wisden asked him in 2003 to dispense some advice to aspiring broadcasters, he suggested: ‘Put your brain into gear before opening your mouth.’ That style – laconic, considered, dry – would become his hallmark, together with an unfailing greeting: ‘Good morning, everyone.’ When Benaud welcomed viewers, they were able to relax: the cricket was about to begin. There were times when you might have longed for him to express himself more trenchantly, to air his opinions more clearly. Surely, you wondered, he must have felt strongly about subjects other than the front-foot no-ball law. But it was not his style – and he remained true to himself. ‘Above all,’ he told Wisden, ‘when commentating, don’t take yourself too seriously, and have fun.’ Benaud was Australia captain and  the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests . After his playing career, Benaud forged an incredibly successful career as a cricket commentator . Benaud (right) in discussion with England's Michael Vaughan ahead of a Test match in 2004 . That last tip has been cheerfully taken on board by the current generation of Channel Nine commentators in Australia. And if they have been less adept at putting their brains into gear before opening their mouths, then that also reflects the almost impossibly high standards set by Benaud himself. His successors were always going to pale by comparison. Behind it all was a quiet, imposing strength. The first time I met him, Benaud almost broke my fingers with his handshake. As a friend noted: ‘You don’t get to captain Australia with a limp wrist.’ Good night, everyone.\",\n",

The next went against the 39-year-old, but breaks of 110 and 139 in consecutive frames suggested O'Sullivan was in unstoppable form, as sweeping through the subsequent three testified.

The 35-year-old from Essex, who trailed 6-2 following Saturday's opening session, won the first frame of the day but lost the next five. A finish with a session to spare was possible when Robertson led 11-3, but Carter took the last two frames of the day to avoid that indignity and trail 11-5 overnight. Earlier, Shaun Murphy left Joe Perry with a mountain to climb as their second-round clash got under way, surging 7-1 in front, while Judd Trump built an early 5-3 lead over Marco Fu.\",\n",

The Rocket raced into a 7-2 lead in his first match at this year’s Betfred World Championship in Sheffield. But five-time champion O’Sullivan, 39, could now face a fine after breaching snooker’s strict dress code against the 32-year-old from Manchester. Ronnie O'Sullivan was forced into borrowing a pair of shoes from a member of the Crucible audience . O'Sullivan played a frame of his encounter against fellow Englishman Craig Steadman in his socks . O'Sullivan leans across the table as he lines up a shot during the first round of the World Championship . O’Sullivan almost made a 147 maximum break in the first frame — missing the 14th red on a run of 104. But he played the sixth frame in his socks after removing some new shoes, complaining about a painful big toe. O’Sullivan saw his lead pegged back to 4-2 after losing that frame — and tried to hand his footwear to a fan. He also asked: ‘Does anyone in here have some size eight or nine shoes I can borrow. I’m serious?’ But tournament director Mike Ganley summoned him out of the arena and lent him his own shoes for the last three frames of the session. The WPBSA dress code reads: ‘Each member shall ensure that their dress and appearance is smart and appropriate for a professional player.’ O’Sullivan was given dispensation to wear casual shoes last year at the UK Championship after breaking his ankle. O'Sullivan claimed he was in discomfort during the match due to an injury he sustained in November . The five-time world champion talks with referee Brendan Moore after borrowing a pair of shoes .

UK Championship (5): 1994, 1998, 2002, 2008, 2015. World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn said: ‘The one thing you can be sure of with Ronnie O’Sullivan is that you have absolutely no idea what he is going to do next. ‘I would rather he played with his shoes on if it all possible though. And what happens if his trousers are a bit tight in the next session of his match?’ Meanwhile, Ding Junhui blew the chance to win £30,000 and become only the seventh player to make a maximum at the Crucible. He incredibly played for the blue after the 13th red following 12 blacks and only gasps from the crowd alerted him to the blunder. Ding looked stunned before a doomed long-distance attempt on the black failed. However, he shrugged off the setback to claim a 10-7 victory. Ding, who now plays John Higgins in the second round, said: ‘I was concentrating so hard I forgot. I had been 4-0 behind and doing everything to get back into the match, and already thinking about trying to win the next frame. ‘I only realised what I had done after playing for the blue because the crowd reacted. Then I checked the scoreboard. Hopfully one day I will get another chance to make a 147 at the Crucible, but it was a bit embarrassing.’ Ali Carter, a two-time Crucible finalist, looked in good touch in his first match at the venue since being given the all-clear from lung cancer. O'Sullivan took to Twitter to post a picture of his inflamed left ankle back in November 2014 . Following a 10-5 win over Alan McManus to set up a clash with Neil Robertson, he said: ‘This is where I feel comfortable and most enjoy playing. I have done everything here except win it and that’s what I am here to do. I didn’t want to come here, get some applause, play like an idiot and go home.’ Mark Allen won an incredible nine frames in a row from 3-1 down to blow away Ryan Day 10-3. The 29-year-old from Northern Ireland, who now plays Barry Hawkins, said: ‘That doesn’t happen very often at this level. But that was my C game. Ryan gave the chances rather than me earning them. I will need to play a lot better to be in the mix for the title.’\",\n",

He struck a free-kick winner from the bench at Aston Villa in early November and was then given a run of games by Mauricio Pochettino, with fellow frontmen Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor failing to deliver. And he has not looked back since. 'It is amazing. It is a very proud moment for myself and my family - hopefully the first of many to come,' Kane said of his award.

'It is incredible, an incredible feeling.' Asked to sum up his season in one word, Kane went for: 'Unreal.' Never doubting himself, had he been told 12 months ago this was his destiny, Kane said: 'I'd have said let's do it - let's get it on. 'A lot has changed since then but I have always believed in my ability and have been waiting for a chance to express myself. I didn't think it would go as quickly as it has done but I have managed to ride the wave and the season has got better and better. 'I got the opportunity with the gaffer and I have really enjoyed my season so far - I have taken my chance and this is why we are here.' Kane has been the shining light of the Tottenham side, and said: 'We have worked hard and I have worked hard to get to where we are now. It is going great and hopefully it is the start with more to come.' His stand-out occasion of the season came not in a Tottenham shirt, but when Roy Hodgson ushered him into the England side, Kane scoring after 79 seconds of his debut off the bench against Lithuania on March 27, in a European Championship qualifier. Asked for his favourite moment, Kane said: 'Making my England debut and getting that goal - it was a very proud moment. It made it even more special. 'For a footballer, to represent their country is the pinnacle, and I'm very proud. I was able to do that and it was a moment I won't forget.' Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino tipped the Chingford-born forward for even bigger things after he scored in the recent 3-1 win at Newcastle, to become the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to reach 30 club goals in a season.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg expressed outrage that the Tories could not be 'bothered' to come clean about their plans. The Lib Dems have vowed to block the plan as the price of any future coalition deal after May 7. Mr Alexander, who served as Chief Secretary for the Treasury, has now released details of benefit cuts put to the Quad of senior ministers, which included him, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Osborne. He said he was lifting the lid on the internal coalition discussions because his former government colleagues were 'trying to con the British people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election'. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told LBC's Nick Ferrari that he backed Mr Alexander's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions . Vince Cable has claimed the Tories have a 'nasty streak' as he warned workers had been hit hard by the coalition he served in. The Business Secretary claimed the Conservatives would resurrect plans to allow bosses to 'fire at will'. He told The Independent: 'They have an unfinished agenda. 'There is a very nasty streak [in the Conservative Party]. They are not all nasty as individuals. 'I have worked with them for five years. Some of them are perfectly decent, moderate people.' But he warned the Tories would 'chisel away' at workers' rights. The Lib Dems revealed that in June 2012, the Quad was sent a document called 'Welfare Reform Quad Summer Reading Pack' produced by officials working for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Mr Alexander said the previously dropped plans - including limiting Child Benefit and Child Tax Credit to two children at a cost of £3,500 for a family of three - were a clear signal of where the axe would fall. But he was forced to admit that many of the claims set out in today's document had been made public - and rejected by the Tories - in the past. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'There are lots of ideas that have been doing the rounds for years, so I think it's not credible for the Conservatives to say they do not know what they're going to do. 'If they are proposing £12billion of welfare savings without knowing what they're going to do, that is highly reckless. 'Equally, if they do know what they want to do and they're not telling the British people, that is deceitful. 'And that does frustrate me because I think that this is one of the issues that in the last seven days of the election campaign people would expect the Conservatives to come clean about.' Mr Clegg  backed Mr Alexander's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions saying the Conservatives needed to say where their planned benefits cuts would fall. 'I share Danny's intense frustration verging on anger that the Conservatives think it is okay a week before an election to say that they are going to take the equivalent of £1,500 off eight million of the most vulnerable families in this country and they can't even be bothered to spell out exactly what their plans involve,' he said on an LBC radio phone-in. But the Conservatives dismissed the claim as 'desperate stuff' from the Liberal Democrats and insisted the proposals were 'definitely not our policy'. Mr Osborne told BBC London: 'Well this is a three year old document of policy options that was commissioned by the chief secretary himself. 'We have not put into practice any of these options. We don't support them. We didn't support them. We don't support them in the future.' Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured in Dewsbury today, said the future of\\xa0child benefit and tax credits is 'on the ballot paper next week' David Cameron will today pledge to cut taxes for the young as he warns Labour would 'reach into your pay packet' by raising them. Young people have been the biggest winners from the increases in the personal allowance since 2010, according to new figures, with five million under-30s gaining an average of £70 a month each from being taken out of income tax. A further 500,000 will gain from the extension of the policy after the election. The announcement is part of a wider offer to young voters today. This includes a target to cut youth unemployment to the lowest level in the G7 group of nations. With just a week to go until polling stations open across the UK on May 7, Mr Cameron told the Guardian it was 'time to throw caution to the winds, let rip and tell people what you really think'. The Prime Minister - who has in recent days deployed a more energetic approach after criticism of a lacklustre pitch to the electorate - said: 'I think we will get there. But the reason it is taking time is, quite rightly, people want to have a good look and a good think.' Tory Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'This is just a desperate attempt by the Lib Dems to try to move their position in the polls, but it's not going to work because these proposals were never proposed or supported by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor and they would never be supported by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor. 'Our principles are very clear when it comes to welfare: it is there to help people, especially to help people get back into work, but also to support the disabled, to support pensioners - and those principles will not change.' Mr Alexander's revelations came as The Times reported growing dissent in Lib Dem ranks over the possibility of entering a second power-sharing deal with the Conservatives if the General Election fails to produce a clear winner. Nick Clegg has based his campaign around the premise that his party would be a restraining influence on either of the main parties. But the newspaper said a number of - mostly unnamed - parliamentarians were increasingly hostile to the prospect of a Tory tie-up, which would have to be approved by a special party conference. Mr Alexander said: 'For five years I won battle after battle to stop the Tories veering off to the right with ideological cuts, and it's been worth it to get the economy back on track while ensuring a fairer society. 'The coalition has delivered savings in a fair way, but the Tories now want to balance the books off the backs of ordinary working families and the most vulnerable in society. 'The Tories have turned their backs on the plan delivered in coalition government. Instead they want to cut £1,500 for eight million households, singling out middle and low-income families to bear the burden - and asking nothing from the best off. 'It's clear from our time in government that the Tories' target will be slashing support for families. I'm lifting the lid on this now because the Conservatives are trying to con the British people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election. 'They now ask the British people to trust them when they make unfunded pledges on health and tax, yet won't tell us how they will cut welfare for millions of families to pay for their plans. They may give with one hand, but they will take away twice as much with the other. 'The Liberal Democrats will take a fairer approach, cutting less than the Conservatives and borrowing less than Labour, to deliver a stronger economy and fairer society with opportunity for everyone.' Labour leader Ed Miliband also seized on the revelation.Speaking ahead of an event in Yorkshire, he said:\\xa0'Today we've learnt that child benefit and tax credits are on the ballot paper next week. 'The Tories have drawn up plans to take thousands of pounds away from millions of families. 'The Tories' secret plan has been revealed. 'And they will put it into practice in just seven days' time if they get the chance. 'It's the final proof that working families can't afford five years of the Tories.\\u200e' CONSERVATIVES .

Ten years ago, bartender Liz Clark did just that when she swapped cleaning glasses for sailing around the world. The 34-year-old left her home in San Diego, California, when she was given a Cal 40 sailboat on the condition that she sail the globe and document her travels. Scroll down for video . Ten years ago, bartender Liz Clark did just that when she swapped cleaning glasses for sailing around the world . The 34-year-old promised to document her travels on a Cal 40 sailboat after being handed inspiration from a retired professor . And for the last decade Liz has been enjoying an idyllic life as she sails alone in a sailboat, travelling about 25,000 nautical miles to date. 'After I graduated from university, I happened to cross paths with a retired professor, Dr. Arent H. Schuyler, who was looking for someone to sail his boat around the world,' says Liz. 'He was 80 years old at the time and just wanted to help someone else realize his dream.' Liz, who studied Environmental Studies at the University of California in Santa Barbara, jumped at the chance. She says: 'At university I learned about all the damage we were doing to the Earth and the unsustainable lifestyles we were leading. 'I looked around me and it seemed like no one was doing anything about it, and I decided that I really didn't want to be a part of it anymore. 'I knew this trip would be everything I loved in one-a simple, eco-friendly lifestyle close to nature, searching for remote uncrowded waves, learning from other cultures, challenging myself physically and mentally, and going on an open-ended adventure.' Liz, who studied Environmental Studies at the University of California in Santa Barbara, jumped at the chance to discover the world . As well as perfect her sailing skills, the ten-year trip has helped Liz perfect her surf-boarding talents . Sailing around the world offers Liz the perfect chance for scenic stop-offs to practise yoga . After graduating from university, Liz worked as a bartender for three years, before quitting her job when the opportunity to sail around the world arose. She spent three years preparing for her voyage and learning how to operate the sailboat. Liz says: 'It was petrifying to leave the safety and security of the dock and my friends and family. 'I didn't know if I would be capable of captaining a boat this big and managing all that goes into a trip where you're off the grid and away from any help - but I knew I had to try or I'd always regret it. 'When I left I didn't know how I'd make money, and I don't come from a wealthy family or anything, like many people assume. 'I was writing blogs the first year and from this I developed a close relationship with Patagonia, an outdoors clothing company - who have been my main financial supporter since the beginning.' It's often hard work for Liz, as she is photographed here \\xa0fixing the anchor in the ground to secure her boat in the eastern South Pacific . Liz did make a friend when she visited Tahiti in 2013, and even took the cat on the boat with her . Her travels around the world have given Liz memories to treasure forvever, including enjoying herself with the locals in Panama in 2007 . Setting off in October 2005, Liz has travelled to a number of exotic destinations, including Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the Galapagos Islands. Liz has documented her travels in a series of envy inducing photographs. She used a timer to take some of the pictures herself, while other photos were taken by locals.

Liz feeds some small sharks whilst on an outer island in the French Polynesia in 2011, during her ten year trip around the world . Liz's daily routine includes adjusting sails and boat maintenance, as well as surfing, yoga, swimming and sleeping under the stars. She says: 'People are generally either awed or jealous, others are totally inspired and excited. 'It feels so great to inspire others to live their dreams, but it's impossible to explain to them what this life is really like; how much hard work there is and that it isn't always easy or fun. 'But that's part of living your dreams - it's never easy, but no work is ever as hard when it's part of your dreams and moving you towards your desires.' The journey throws up daily challenges for Liz, shown here as she battles tough weather in the eastern Pacific in 2008 .

The trip offered Liz the chance to do some teaching at a school in outer islands French Polynesia, in 2011 . Liz says: 'I get lonely at times and still hope to find a complimentary sailing partner. 'The kindness of strangers wherever I go, along with the remote love and support from family and friends, always fills up that emptiness whenever I feel a void.' In 2011, the man responsible for Liz's adventure, Dr. Schuyler, died, aged 87. Liz says: 'He never wanted to be on the boat. He just wanted to help me live my dream and live vicariously through me.

              " {'sequence': \"A sales manager who claimed he was left too disabled to work after a 'minor' road accident ten years ago has been accused of attempting a £600,000 fraud - after being pictured out in a coffee shop with his celebrity friend Max Clifford. Kevin Morgan, 55, of Weybridge in Surrey, was injured when  a Land Rover Discovery reversed into his stationary Rover 75 while he was working in Dorset in September 2005. The married engineer suffered whiplash, which developed into chronic pain syndrome and a resulting deep depression, which together have ended his working life, his lawyers claim. But as his £600,000 damages claim began at the Central London County Court, he was accused of a staggering fraud by motor insurers, Direct Line Group. Kevin Morgan (pictured right) was filmed meeting up in a coffee shop with his friend Max Clifford (pictured left). Morgan claims that a car accident in 2005 has left him in too much pain to leave his home regularly . William Featherby QC, for Direct Line, said Mr Morgan had been put under surveillance and shown to be far from the disabled wreck he claims to be. He could be seen out walking, joking with a builder, striking up conversation with a stranger, crouching to fix the light on his car and as part of a gathering of friends – including disgraced PR guru Clifford – in a coffee shop. 'We submit that the surveillance evidence shows no sign of disability or distress whatever; rather, it just shows a normal man of Mr Morgan's age,' said the barrister. 'The court can properly find that he has been and is exaggerating deliberately to an unconscionable degree.' The court heard Mr Morgan claims he is in so much pain, particularly in his neck, that he only rarely leaves his house. But the QC said he had been watched by private investigators on 12 random days over three years up to 2013 and seen leaving his house on 10 of those days. 'On the 10 days, you were out and about, walking briskly and behaving perfectly normally,' he told Mr Morgan. 'When we see you on those 10 occasions, your neck doesn't go into spasm. It's lies.' Mr Morgan is pictured outside Central London County Court where the fraud case hearing continues . Questioned on the difference in his demeanour on the day in the coffee shop and in court, Mr Morgan said one had been a 'good' day and the other 'bad'. 'I'm not a dishonest person and I feel like it's almost like I'm on a murder charge,' he told Judge David Mitchell. 'I feel like I need to clear my name.' His barrister Simon Browne QC said the surveillance footage shown in court actually backed Mr Morgan's case. 'It reinforces Mr Morgan's post-accident limitations, as his daily life has been reduced to a 1,350 foot radius around his home,' he said. 'The footage proves that he no longer participates in the maintenance and DIY activities that were once such a large part of his life.' The court heard that, before the accident and until 2009, Mr Morgan had worked as a senior accounts manager for a tools manufacturer. He was a golfer and especially houseproud, keeping his home and garden in an 'immaculate' condition, doing bricklaying, carpentry, plumbing and decorating himself. He and his partner of more than 30 years, Deloris, holidayed often, visiting Greece, Germany, Turkey and various destinations in the UK. The accident, and its after-effects, put an end to all that, Mr Browne told the judge. Neck pain progressed to headaches, with blurred and double vision. His sleep was badly affected and he had numbness in his hands. A consultant psychiatrist who assessed him said his depression was most likely to have been caused by being told his chronic pain was 'likely to be incurable', he added. Experts said he would probably never work again and was more likely to remain in a 'retired' lifestyle, even at only 55 years old, he continued. If his claim was really fraudulent, he had managed to pull the wool over doctors' and other specialists' eyes for years, said the barrister. And, by taking such a claim to court, he was risking losing his home if it went against him, Mr Browne added. However, Mr Featherby said the accident was 'not serious' and 'low impact', occurring when another driver reversed into Mr Morgan's car as he sat stationary in a residential street. It displaced the bumper from his car, but he put it back on with the help of another and did not need to take any time off work immediately afterwards, said the QC. He said Direct Line accepted the accident was genuine and that Mr Morgan initially required attention for his injuries. However, the QC is focusing his specific allegation of 'fraud' on the time after 2009, when Mr Morgan was made redundant from his job. Mr Morgan strongly refutes Direct Line's accusations. The hearing continues.\",\n",

Goodbye to the brash, flash, bombastic Floyd Jnr. Well, more or less. Hello to the mature Mr Mayweather who weighs his words carefully and respects one and all. Well, mostly. He has been slammed for pronouncing himself superior to Ali so he said: 'I respect all the great champions of the past. But I've done just as much as Ali did. 'He was champion at heavyweight but I've won world titles in five divisions. He fought for a helluva cause (anti-Vietnam War) but I'm still sharp at age 38. Still going strong at age 38.

'His fighter is not talking like that and it's only me and Pacquiao who will do the fighting. I wish Freddie well.' The new, considerate Floyd choked up a little when asked about important influences who had inspired him to greatness. He took us back to Grand Rapids and a certain Mr Frank Brown, saying: 'He was important to me from the age of three, Like a grandfather. He would drive me to fights in my amateur days (no Money back then). Sometimes hundreds of miles. He believed in me more than anyone. He told me I'd make it. He took me to church. 'He came to so many of my fights right up to Oscar De La Hoya. But he's not doing well now. He's in an old folks home. He's losing his memory. It hurts. I love the guy so much. I think about him every day.' It went quiet for a moment on the line. It seemed like a good time to ask why he had changed from cocksure to contemplative almost to the point of silence.

And he welcomes the challenge which some think threatens his unbeaten legacy: 'I respect Manny Pacquaio. To be here now he must be doing something right. 'We reached the point where this fight had to happen. He's one of the last great fighters of our time left for me to defeat. I'm glad it's happening.' He goes back again to a moment in his youth: 'When I was 17 or 18 Mike Tyson had come out of prison. I went to the MGM to watch him fight. Busy?

But he and Terry are not shaped that way and the pride burned through their yellow shirts as they led their team-mates to salute three thousand noisy Chelsea supporters in the corner of the King Power Stadium. They had trailed to a goal from Marc Albrighton after a slightly lethargic first-half display but came out inspired and soon levelled through Drogba, before Terry put the Londoners ahead, 12 minutes from time, and Ramires curled the third into the top corner. The strike by Ramires triggered an ironic chorus of 'Boring Boring Chelsea' from the visiting fans and they sang long into the night, aware that their team can be crowned champions on Sunday at Stamford Bridge if they beat Crystal Palace. Mourinho tried to play down the party vibe but they will come in expectation because this has the feel of a procession after breaking through an awkward sequence of games with only one fit centre-forward, who happened to be 37.

Drogba’s legs don’t cover quite the same ground at quite the same rate as they once did. He rarely gets clear of the back-line, it has been a long time since he screamed one into the top corner and his touch can be heavy. Until Wednesday night it had been a long time since he found the net. You have to go all the way back to Newcastle away in December, when he came on in a bid to rescue Chelsea from their first defeat of the campaign, and almost managed it. Drogba has an impossible-to-pin-down ability to influence the game and his desire glows as fiercely as ever. He energised Chelsea with the equaliser - just as he once did in Munich in the Champions League final. He missed chances and he might have scored more, but he never stopped showing for the ball or leading by example to those team-mates who have yet to cross this finish-line in a title race, as injured striker Diego Costa and Loic Remy looked on from the stands. Mourinho wanted all of his squad to travel and prepare together at St George’s Park as a show of solidarity as they closed in on the goal. This was where the head-tennis video was filmed which went viral on Wednesday. Six Chelsea players headed the ball back and forth across the dinner table until it reached John Obi Mikel, on the end, who nodded it into a bin. Judging by the celebrations which followed, Remy is not far from a return.

Chelsea's players looked dejected after falling behind to Albrighton's goal just before the end of the second half . On Wednesday, it was over to the legends who have made the journey before to respond to the challenge set down by Nigel Pearson’s vibrant team, who offered more evidence, even in defeat, that they are capable of surviving the drop. Terry scored his seventh of the season, forcing the ball in from close range after Kasper Schmeichel had saved from Gary Cahill at a corner. And Petr Cech came in for Thibaut Courtois and played superbly, making a crucial save to thwart Paul Konchesky when the game was goalless. Courtois hurt his hip during Sunday’s draw at Arsenal and was on the bench. Cech came in for only his fifth Premier League game of the season, but buoyed by the knowledge he had not conceded in this competition for more than a year. Leicester started at a healthy tempo, seeking to use the electric pace of Jamie Vardy, only to see their rhythm disrupted to injuries which forced Andy King and Robert Huth off before the interval. Chelsea dominated from midway through the first half but that did not prevent Leicester from taking the lead on the break when Matty James released Vardy down the left. Vardy beat Terry to the ball and cut his cross low and deep. It might have been aimed at Leonardo Ulloa, but it bypassed the Argentine striker and Cesar Azpilicueta slipped as he tried to adjust his feet.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (right) and Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson have a talk in the tunnel before kick off . The upshot was a simple finish for Albrighton, arriving late with the ball set nicely and Cech’s goal hopelessly exposed. He had not scored for more than four years but he made no mistake, sliding it low into the net. The King Power erupted as home fans detected an improbably fifth win on the bounce and another year in this lofty company. But Drogba soon punctured those hopes when he reacted swiftly to beat substitute Ritchie de Laet to a low cross from Branislav Ivanovic and hooked it past Schmeichel. It was a different game from this point. Chelsea had re-emerged in a different mood. There was extra urgency about their game and they would go on to win by more than one goal for the first time since a 5-0 win against Swansea in mid-January. Drogba fired one chance over and another wide but Terry produced the second, just as it seemed Mourinho would have to settle for a point. It could have been many more but Ramires made it three. And it wasn’t boring at all.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Steve Davis would love to see Jimmy White and Reanne Evans light up the Crucible stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn. The king of the baize in the 1980s believes the Whirlwind and the doyenne of the women's tour face tall orders to get through qualifying for the Betfred World Championship. Evans saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion Ken Doherty on Thursday, in the first of three preliminary rounds, while White will tackle fellow veteran James Wattana in his opener on Saturday. Steve Davis will attempt to qualify for this year's Betfred World Championship at the Crucible . But Davis, who will also attempt to qualify, expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in Sheffield. He calls 29-year-old Dudley potter Evans 'a great player', and said of the 10-time ladies' world champion: 'It's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods. It's a bun fight, but she's perhaps the best woman player I've ever seen. 'In the 1980s I saw Allison Fisher who was the best around, and she was an excellent, excellent player but more methodical. 'Reanne is more like the Jimmy White or the Ronnie O'Sullivan of the women's game. She has the feel for the game, she's at one with the table. 'She could cause a surprise, but to win three matches is the tough bit. It's hard enough for me and Jimmy. 'If me or Jimmy qualify for the Crucible, it's arguably as big a win as we've ever had. 'I've got a little bit of a desire to do it, but Jimmy would certainly love to get back to the Crucible.' Reanne Evans takes on Ken Docherty for a place at the World Championships in Sheffield . Reanne Evans is a 10-time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010-11 season. She suffered 18 consecutive defeats however and failed to qualify the following year. White, who lost six World Championship finals, last appeared at the tournament in 2006, and has fallen short in qualifying every year since. While 52-year-old White is in the autumn of his career, for Davis these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down. He turns 58 in August and fell off the main tour 12 months ago. A memoir, Interesting, hits the bookshelves on Thursday. A tricky qualifying opener against Jamie Cope could end in disappointment, but it would be short-lived. 'I can't build up the intensity that I used to have, but I must admit I'm getting excited about pitting my wits against another generation of players,' Davis said. 'Of course, it'll all end in tears. 'I'm not totally committed but I still have the juices running through me a little bit. I've been practising but it's not a pretty sight. They're wobbling more in the pockets before saying 'nope'. 'Whether I get to the TV stages, that's a long shot. That's tough. Jimmy White will take on fellow veteran James Wattana in qualifying on Thursday . 'I was still practising hard even when I wasn't getting to the latter stages of the Crucible, and in the end you have to say, 'Yeah, I've tried, but the price is too much investment of time'. 'Now if I've lost a match, by the time I've got in the car I've thought about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day, rather than beating up the person who's come up with me. 'I think it's been a bit like Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I'm sure in the night that someone swapped me for a more mellow version.' Davis won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament, but the 1985 'black-ball final' defeat to Dennis Taylor stands over and above all memories. Dennis Taylor in action during the memorable 1985 World Championship final against Davis . The second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant Davis having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again. 'I don't remember anything as much as I remember the '85 final,' Davis said. 'I do remember the last frame, more so because I've watched it through on video a few times. 'My career was a blur and all games and matches blur into one in the end, it's only the strange moments that do stick in your brain.'

The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines. He spent the early part of his career boxing in the Far East before being given his chance on the big stage in 2001 against Lehlo Ledwaba in an IBF world super-bantamweight title fight in Las Vegas.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss  against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival. The welterweight rivals were both due to attend the traditional grand arrival that marks the beginning of fight week only for Arum to withdraw Pacquiao, claiming the event is a 'waste of time'. Arum also pulled the plug on a media conference call with Pacquiao last week before a question had been asked, while Mayweather spoke for almost half an hour the following night.

George Clooney's newlywed wife appeared before reporters at the National Press Club at 10am Thursday, accompanied by Laila Ali, the wife of the jailed politician, and Jared Genser, the founder of the organization Freedom Now. Nasheed, the Indian Ocean archipelago's first democratically elected leader who came to power in 2008, was convicted under tough anti-terror laws last month and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Scroll down for video . Amal Clooney held a press conference in Washington DC today calling for the release of imprisoned former president of Maldives Mohamed Nasheed . Clooney, 37, appeared before reporters at the National Press Club in the capital . Mrs Clooney wore a navy blue pants suit paired with a plain white blouse beneath her single-button jacket . Mrs Clooney is part of a high-profile international legal team representing ousted and jailed Maldivian ex-President Nasheed, who has been sentenced to 13 years in prison . In her remarks Thursday in Washington, Mrs Clooney said she will not rest until Nasheed walks free. The case against the president, who was ousted in 2012 in what has been described by hs supporters as a coup, stemmed from the alleged wrongful detention of a judge by the Maldivian military. The Maldives leader's trial has sparked international concern for the fledgling island democracy after local and foreign human rights activists said the former president's imprisonment was politically motivated. Amnesty International panned the 'sham trial,' and said the verdict was a 'travesty of justice,' according to a press release put out by the National Press Club Thursday. In early April, Nasheed announced a high-profile legal team, including Amal Clooney, will spearhead a fresh attempt to secure his release. In her prepared remarks Thursday in Washington, Mrs Clooney said she will not rest until Nasheed walks free, reported the India's Focus News. The British-Lebanese attorney said she will appeal to the US government to put pressure on the government of Maldives to release her client .

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has made the headlines throughout his trophy-laden career but it appears a novel way has been created to find any information purely about the maverick 32-year-old striker. Search engine zlaaatan.com has immortalised the Paris Saint-Germain forward with the site totally devoted to the French giants\\' No 10. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had a search engine website created in his honour called\\xa0zlaaatan.com . The website has an identical  style to Google with users given the option\\xa0to \\'Zlatan Search\\' or \\'I\\'m feeling Zlatan\\' In a house style that is identical to Google, and operates just like the search engine, users have the option to \\'Zlatan Search\\' or \\'I\\'m feeling Zlatan.\\' The click of the former button takes users to articles about Ibrahimovic on Google, while the latter directs them to his Wikipedia page. In addition any results from the search bar will automatically add \\'Zlatan\\' to the front - meaning he will forever be at the forefront of the news. It must be said though that website is neither affiliated with Ibrahimovic nor Google. The website though has no affliation with the Paris Saint-Germain No 10 (left) nor Google . Creative director of  SweetPop, the agency that came up with the website idea, Andreas Killander hopes the search engine will bring a smile to the Sweden international. \\'We didn\\'t ask his permission, but we hope he sees it as an amusing experience,\\' he said. \\'Our search engine is linked to Google but all the searches are Zlatanified. All the results have some link to Zlatan... if you type in Ferrari, you\\'ll get stuff about Zlatan\\'s Ferrari; if you want a recipe, you\\'ll get the Zlatan Burger. \\'Zlatan is an idol. He\\'s known the world over. That\\'s why we chose him.\\' SweetPop, the agency that came up with the website idea, hope that Ibrahimovic (left) will find it amusing . As memorable as he can be with his feet, Zlatan Ibrahimovic can also do likewise with his tongue.

I certainly don\\'t need the Ballon d\\'Or to prove that I am number one.\\' Ibrahimovic may not have been named on the shortlist for the 2012 Ballon d\\'Or award, but it clearly didn\\'t affect the striker\\'s confidence in his own ability. \\'A World Cup without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the World Cup.\\' Ibrahimovic came up against Cristiano Ronaldo in the play-off to reach the World Cup in Brazil last summer, but it was Sweden that were on the losing side and the PSG forward let everyone know there wasn\\'t much point in watching a tournament that didn\\'t feature himself. \\'I couldn’t believe it. I was like \"No way, Zlatan doesn’t do auditions\".\\' Arsene Wenger revealed that he came close to signing Ibrahimovic when he was a fresh-faced 16-year-old but he refused to have a trial at the north London club. \\'Nothing. She already has Zlatan.\\' As any man will attest to, buying a gift for your loved one can be a difficult task. Not for Ibrahimovic though, who admits his wife needs nothing else for her birthday when she already has Zlatan. \\'Well, I don’t know. You’ll have to ask your wife about that.\\' As a member of the media you have to remember to choose your questions carefully when interviewing Ibrahimovic. This reporter wasn\\'t, and asked the striker how he got the scars on his face. \\'What Carew does with a football, I can do with an orange.\\' Ibrahimovic didn\\'t take too kindly to criticism from Scandinavian counterpart and former Aston Villa and West Ham striker John Carew. \\'Come to my house and you\\'ll see if I\\'m gay, and bring your sister.\\' During his spell at Barcelona a picture emerged of Ibrahimovic getting rather close to team-mate Gerard Pique but the Sweden international strongly refuted suggestions he was gay, particularly when they were voiced by one female reporter. \\'It was the fault of David Trezeguet, who made me do one drink of vodka after another. I slept in the bathtub. Now I hold my vodka much better.\\' Ibrahimovic tried to pass the blame to former Juventus team-mate David Trezeguet after reports of excessive behaviour following the club\\'s Serie A title success. \\'I like fireworks too, but I set them off in gardens or kebab stands. I never set fire to my own house.\\' After Mario Balotelli, a former team-mate of Ibrahimovic\\'s at Inter Milan, set fire to his bathroom when he let fireworks of out the window, the PSG hitman admitted his like for fireworks. \\'You bought a Ferrari but you drive it like a Fiat.\\' Ibrahimovic\\'s short and tumultuous stint in La Liga with Barcelona was riddled with arguments and falling outs, particularly with manager Pep Guardiola and the 33-year-old was not happy with his role in the team.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'TESTOSTERONE . by Joe Herbert . (OUP £16.99) Testosterone doesn’t always get a good press. Everything that’s unpleasant about male behaviour has been ascribed to the effects of this much maligned hormone. Violence? It’s all testosterone’s fault. Sexual assault and rape? Just blame testosterone. Yet, as Joe Herbert makes clear in his engaging whistlestop tour of the science surrounding it, testosterone is at the heart of human life. ‘Without our father’s testosterone,’ as he writes, ‘none of us would exist.’ It has only one basic function — to enable a male to reproduce, and for that it’s essential. Although this is the case and it’s impossible to think of ‘maleness’ without testosterone, it’s also important for sexual behaviour in women. The blood of an adult woman before menopause actually contains about five times more testosterone than oestrogen, the supposedly ‘female’ hormone. However, it’s as a metaphor for masculinity that testosterone is best known. All that’s unpleasant about male behaviour is ascribed to testosterone, yet as Joe Herbert explains, testosterone is at the heart of human life . It begins its influence in the womb as it helps to shape the distinctive characteristics of the male body. This influence continues immediately after birth. That three-month-old baby boy, sweetly smiling at you from his pram, may well have testosterone levels that rival his father’s. We don’t know why but, starting two weeks after birth and lasting for four to six months, a little boy’s testes are producing testosterone in substantial amounts. The hormone’s power then recedes, but returns — and how! — in puberty. Post-puberty, testosterone drives the competition for females. In the animal world, stags lock antlers, elephants enter the aggressive state known as musth and male rhinos go horn-to-horn. Even male giraffes, aroused by the hormone’s influence, flail at one another with their long necks. Elaborate colourings emerge in some species, designed to emphasise masculinity and attract female attention. In guenon monkeys the scrotum turns bright blue. They don’t seem to mind. They adopt the habit of sitting with their legs apart to show the female guenons just how big and blue they are. We can only be thankful that testosterone’s effects on sexual display in humans are not so visually dramatic. Adult human males have varying levels of the hormone in different circumstances. Entirely unsurprisingly, having sex increases testosterone levels. So, too, does talking to an attractive woman and watching pornographic movies. Winning at sports sends the levels racing upwards. Just supporting a winning team can have the same effect. It works in politics as well. A study showed that, during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, Barack Obama supporters were pumped full of testosterone. Levels fell in the supporters of his defeated rival, John McCain. Testosterone also helps in the City. Another study, on a London trading floor, showed that male traders made more money on days on which their morning testosterone levels were higher than usual. A challenge is obviously stimulating. Surgeons facing difficult procedures often find their testosterone levels shooting up. One would assume that the theatre of war would have the same effect as the operating theatre, if not more so. After all, testosterone is supposed to be the hormone behind violence and aggression. In fact, soldiers in the heat of battle can have testosterone levels not much above those of men who have been castrated. It’s the appalling stress that reduces it. Once they leave the front line, however, the soldiers revert to more normal levels. When levels are high, the effects of testosterone on male behaviour are so strong that the human brain has had to find a multitude of ways of regulating and channelling them. The creation of laws, religion and customs has, to some extent, been shaped by the need to do so. In that sense, as Joe Herbert writes, ‘testosterone lies at the heart of much of our history’. His own fascination with the ‘simple but wondrous chemical’ that is his subject is clear. His book does a fine job of conveying that fascination to the rest of us.',\n",

It seems like only yesterday that Zac Efron's baby blues peeped out at from beneath his sweeping fringe as he serenaded us in High School Musical. But at the age of just 19, and playing a 16 year old, it felt rather creepy having a schoolgirl crush on the young star. So now he's 27 we are more than happy to be able to perve over his bulging biceps, hard six pack and toned legs... At first, Zac appeared to be among the few male child stars who have blossomed as adults, with the girls ruling the 'I was cute and now I'm hot' world. The obvious exceptions are Ryan Gosling - is there a hot list he isn't on? - and Justin Timberlake. Both were in the Mickey Mouse Club, along with Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, plus Gosling starred as Young Hercules in a TV series of the same name at the age of 18. Always a handsome lad, Ryan Gosling went from a blond 'young Hercules' to appearing on every hot list ever . Justin has sorted his hair, got rid of those awful earrings and, how do we say this - grown into his face . After digging a little deeper, however, we remembered Slater from Saved by the Bell, aka Mario Lopez, whose dimples have dazzled for decades. Also Joseph Gordon-Levitt who surprised us all when he grew from being the long-haired awkward boy in Third Rock from the Sun into a suave-looking gent who knows how to work a suit. Then there's Taylor Lautner, who has such a baby face we still consider him to be a youngster, but at the grand old age of 23 and with some manly facial hair, he's now made it onto our list.

But back in the early 21st century, taking a picture was an entirely different process, requiring patience, precision and a very talented eye.

A collection of pictures of Christina O'Gorman posing for her father, electrical engineer and photographer Mervyn O'Gorman, back in 1913 have been revealed as some of the earliest colour photographs ever taken .

The images are part of the Royal Photographic Society, held at the National Media Museum, and are currently on display at the National Media Museum, Bradford. They are among a collection of the world's oldest surviving photographs. The woman in question was teenager Christina O'Gorman, posing for her father, electrical engineer and photographer Mervyn O'Gorman back in 1913. Mervyn was 42 at the time when he took the images of his daughter, who languidly sits, in an array of vibrant red outfits, including a swimsuit, a cloak and a shirt. The teen, characterised by her long strawberry-blonde hair, poses in different scenarios on the beach at Lulworth Cove in the English county of Dorset and appears unaware of her father. The delicately-coloured images are on display at the National Media Museum in Bradford . Christina is seen sitting on the Dorset beach with friends in the 102-year-old images .

Christina's life remains a mystery as there are no recorded detail of the then-teen's life . The National Media Museum explained: 'The comparatively long exposure time has given the sea a glassy quality and the large aperture setting and narrow depth of field has put Durdle Door in the background into soft focus.' The repetition of the red attire was due to the fact that the vibrant colour captured particularly well in an autochrome process. Mervyn died in 1958, with his wife Florence passing 27 years beforehand in 1931. As to Christina's life, there are no recorded details.\",\n",

The Manchester middleweight takes on Dollaway in Montreal on Saturday night bidding to avoid losing successive fights for the first time in his career. And assuming he does so, Bisping is open to fighting again in Glasgow this July, five years since he last fought in the UK. Michael Bisping gets up close to CB Dolloway during the UFC 186 weigh-in at Metropolis on Friday . ‘I know it’s a cliche but I feel like I’m in the best shape of my life. I’m ready to take on the world, and by world I mean CB Dollaway,’ he said. ‘For me it’s just another day in the office. This is what I love to do, this is what I was put on this earth to do. ‘Make no mistake, I’m going to deliver for the fans in Montreal. ‘He’s going to look for a takedown, I’m going to stop that takedown. ‘I’m in the best training situation of my life – if I had this type of training my entire career, I’d have been a world champion five years ago. I just have to prove to the world I’m still one of the best. I’ll beat CB, then I’ll beat someone else and then you’ll hear me start talking about that title shot again. ‘I haven’t fought in the UK in five years. After this fight, if the UFC wants me to fight on the Glasgow card I’ll do it. I’ll fight anywhere in the UK. I’m an Englishman at heart and it’s been far too long since I’ve been able to fight in the UK.’ Bisping looks to get back to winning ways against Dolloway\\xa0 in Canada this weekend . Bisping is coming off the back of a defeat by Luke Rockhold last November but still considers himself among the best in the world. ‘I’m expecting the best CB Dollaway there is, and I expect him to be confident. But his courage will diminish as the fight goes on, and I will knock him out,’ he added. ‘CB Dollaway is a very good athlete. He’s a great wrestler, he’s a mediocre striker – I’m by far a better striker. ‘I’ve never lost two fights back to back. I need to put a win streak together. But I still consider myself one of the best in the world. ‘The last fight against Rockhold, we clashed heads and I couldn’t see too well – he caught me with a head kick and that was it. ‘I know I’ve had my setbacks, they’ve been well documented. There’s no shame in losing to the guys I’ve lost to; they’re all guys who could be world champions. Dana White called me after the Luke Rockhold fight and told me the reason I was losing fights is because I’m consistently fighting the best guys in the world – not everyone can say that. ‘I’m going to prove that I’m still one of the best in the world.’',\n",

Spurs are sixth in the Barclays Premier League, which would bring European qualification, but there has been talk in the past that Europe's second-tier competition does them more harm than good. Eriksen says the benefits of qualifying\\xa0outweigh\\xa0the negatives, though, and admits that the prospect of Europa\\xa0League football played a big part when he decided to move to White Hart Lane in 2013. Christian Eriksen has warned Tottenham they will struggle to attract top players if they miss out on Europe . Eriksen says the benefits of qualifying for the much-maligned Europa League outweigh the negatives . The lack of Champions League football - which Spurs have missed out on since the 2010-11 season - is seen as a barrier to signing top-class players for clubs of Tottenham's size, but Eriksen says missing out on the Europa League would have the same effect. 'Is it a factor when the club are trying to sign players? I think so,' Eriksen said. 'It certainly was for me when I moved from Ajax two years ago. 'I always want to play in Europe, to be seen on that stage or in the Premier League. It was a big chance and for me it was a nice thing when I came to Tottenham.' Tottenham have been linked with Marseille midfielder Florian Thauvin and Dynamo Kiev forward Andriy Yarmolenko, and Eriksen worries that Spurs could have to lower their sights if they are not on the European stage next season. Mauricio Pochettino's side currently sit sixth in the Barclays Premier League, which is enough to qualify . Eriksen says the lure of Europa League football was important in his decision to join Spurs back in 2013 . And while he admits that missing out makes finishing higher up the table easier, Eriksen doesn't see many issues with the competition itself. 'I'd rather play in Europe than nothing,' he told the Evening Standard. 'There are many games, of course, but if you have a big squad as we have, it shouldn't be a disappointment to play in Europe. A lot of players want to be in Europe. We've been fighting to get into the top four and we still have a little chance. Florian Thauvin (right), the Marseille midfielder, is one player who has been linked with a move to Spurs . Dynamo Kiev's Andriy  Yarmolenko is thought to be another target for Tottenham in the summer market . 'Of course, it is easier to get into the top four if you are not in Europe. There are so many games and we have played more games than most teams in the Premier League this season.' As it stands, the Premier League's top six will all qualify for Europe but if Arsenal win the FA Cup final against Aston Villa that number would extend to the seventh-placed side. West Ham could also find themselves in the Europa League next season if they qualify via the Fair Play Table.\",\n",

The 25-year-old England centre-back had been linked with a move to Arsenal after struggling to hold down a first-team place at United and being branded ‘stupid’ by manager Louis van Gaal for his sending-off in the Manchester derby at the Etihad earlier this season. Smalling was also guilty of several off-the-field indiscretions, including being pictured going to a fancy-dress party as a suicide bomber last year. Chris Smalling (left) signs his new Manchester United contract alongside club boss Louis van Gaal . Smalling celebrates scoring United's fourth goal during their 4-2 Premier League win against Manchester City . But the defender has matured under Van Gaal and become a regular starter in the Dutchman’s team this season. He was due to be out of contract next summer but has now committed himself to United until 2019. Van Gaal said: ‘I am delighted he has signed a new contract. Chris has improved and developed immensely during the short time that I have been at the club and has become an integral part of the first-team squad. ‘He always conducts himself in a very professional manner and it is also pleasing that he has scored some important goals this season too.’ Smalling, who cost United £10million from Fulham in 2010, has made 147 appearances and won two Premier League titles. Four of his nine goals for the club have come this season, including one in the Old Trafford derby earlier this month as United beat City 4-2. The 25-year-old has become a regular for Van Gaal after struggling for a first time place earlier this season . He said: ‘I am so proud to play for such a great club. We have developed as a team over the course of the season under Louis van Gaal and we are now playing as a complete unit. ‘This is a very exciting time to be at Manchester United. We are all determined to get back to where we belong and competing at the highest level.’ Smalling has established himself as a permanent member of England's squad during the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign and that boils down to his vast improvement under Van Gaal.

With a top four finish and Champions League qualification close to being secured, the 25-year-old can look forward to more European adventures as his development continues. After the disappointment of last season, Van Gaal has instilled a level of confidence into his players and Smalling has thrived under his tenure since the turn of the year. The former Fulham man is keeping big summer signing Marcos Rojo out of the side at and that's testament to his improvements after a difficult start to the season. Smalling is expected to keep his place in United's starting eleven for the visit to Everton, as the Red Devils look to get back to winning ways after defeat at Chelsea.

For the moment, summer is cancelled for the defender - at least until he knows where he'll be playing next season. His contract at Manchester City expires at the end of the season, when he becomes a free agent. The next few months will be vital in determining whether Richards can resurrect his once burgeoning career. Micah Richards has found playing time hard to come by during his loan move to Italian side Fiorentina . Richards joined the Serie A side after being frozen out at City - and will be on the move again this summer . He knows it, too, choosing to delay any holidays until his next destination is finalised. Likewise, he's taken the decision to change representation, striking an agreement with Wasserman Media Group - the firm that look after Steven Gerrard. His season-long loan in Florence hasn't been a disaster, but you can hardly call it an overwhelming success. Unable to hold down a regular place in Vincenzo Montella's starting XI this season, Richards has had ample time to reflect on his career so far. Tipped as the future of England's defence, Richards' career has been on steady decline. But at the age of 26-year-old, there's time for Richards to buck that recent trend. Richards celebrates with Yaya Toure and Gael Clichy at his boyhood club, where his contract ends this year . Ricahrds is set on a return to the Premier League, shown here in 2011 skipping past Arsenal's Gervinho . He's enjoyed his time in Italy; he likes the lifestyle. But the defender is almost certain that he wants to return to the Premier League ahead of next season. Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini would sign Richards in a heartbeat. He tried, and failed, to sign him on loan in January. The possibility of a permanent reunion with Mancini, who nurtured Richards' career at Manchester City, this summer is a real one for the defender. But the drive to prove he can still be a force in England is strong. Richards has unfinished business on these shores. Richards will not be short of suitors. Aston Villa, Southampton, Everton and West Ham are showing an interest. On paper, a move for Richards this summer is a no brainer. A Premier League winner, close to 200 top-flight appearances under his belt, still only 26 and available on a free transfer. The Birmingham-born 26 year old was England's first choice right-back as a youngster . You don't get many of those to the pound. The pound, though, isn't something Richards will be too concerned with this summer. Talk to those close to the defender, they'll tell you he simply wants to get back to playing regular football - not once every two or three weeks. Richards, who is currently nursing a slight ankle injury, wants to be a mainstay at his next club - and that will be the determining factor when he makes his decision. His versatility is also likely to be a major selling point. We know Richards as a right-back - but he's developed a penchant for playing as a central defender in recent seasons. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood is willing to offer the former England man a place at the heart of his defence . And it is at centre-back where Richards sees his long-term career. Sportsmail understands Tim Sherwood would be willing to offer Richards a slot in the heart of his defence next season in an attempt to lure him to Villa Park. But, more than anything else, Richards knows he has to play. Prestige will have nothing to do with his next move. If offered the chance of playing a peripheral role for a high-profile club or a regular position elsewhere, he'll choose the latter. The sooner he makes his decision, the sooner he can get on with booking his summer holidays.\",\n",

But with the cost of maintenance and repairs to damaged public housing nearing $13 million a year in NSW alone, the State Government has had enough and is planning to make tenants pay a bond before they move in. Communities Minister Brad Hazzard said it was a 'very likely possibility' the plan would be implemented in the near future. 'The critical argument for it is that at the moment the maintenance costs, including damage from poor tenancy, are in the order of approximately $12-13 million per year,' Mr Hazzard told Daily Mail Australia. A picture from the NSW Department of Family and Community Services shows damage to public housing . Public housing tenants will  pay a bond under a NSW government plan to recoup losses from trashed properties . The state's new Community Services Minister Brad Hazzard said the annual bill for repairs and maintenance on taxpayer-funded housing had hit $12 million . Mr Hazzard added that he was unsure as to why public housing tenants have never been made to pay a bond similar to that paid by private renters . 'I'd like to see at least a reasonable portion of that money saved and put into more public housing. We have very long public housing tenancy waiting lists.' Mr Hazzard, who took over the portfolio after the March election, said he was alerted to the fact public housing tenants don't pay a bond when consulting with workers in the field. He added that introducing a bond was not a new idea or 'rocket science'. 'My job is to make sure I use taxpayers money very wisely and maximise the opportunities for public housing for other people that wait years,' Mr Hazzard said. The Minister\\xa0said it would most likely be a one month bond, paid off over six months to a year. He said it would be possible to make exceptions in certain circumstance – for example women escaping domestic violence. Mr Hazzard added public housing tenants were already liable for damage but 'they don't have the money'. Pictured is a trashed public housing property in Hornsby, in the northern suburbs of Sydney . Mr Hazzard, who took over the portfolio after the March election, said he was alerted to the issue when consulting with workers in the field . Damage can also be seen to the garage door, and the backyard is piled up with junk . 'Generally it's very hard to retrospectively try to get money from tenants when they've moved out,' he said. 'This is about sending a forward message, a very clear and upfront message, that you will be responsible for the damage.' Ned Cutcher, policy officer at the NSW Tenants' Union, said public housing tenants were already liable if they caused damage to properties. 'Tenants are always liable for the damage they cause, the question of the bond is really just about making sure there's a little bit of money there so landlords can have ready access to money,' Mr Cutcher said. 'I don't think the government should be looking at that in the same way as private landlord, who might struggle to cover costs. 'The government landlord isn't going to find themselves in a situation where they're going to be short of cash.' Mr Cutcher added that damage was often unfairly attributed to tenants. Green mouldy bread and stacks of filthy dishes seen piling up in the kitchen that hasn't been cleaned . Mr Hazzard said the bond would be able to be paid in instalments. 'They may not have the money to pay it in one hit, that's understandable,' he said . 'Some of those photos indicate something else is going on, properties are being vandalised it's not just people not looking after their properties,' he said. 'Tenants are usually very happy to have a social housing property, something they can afford, and it sure beats homelessness so they'll look after it on the whole. 'Problems occur when properties are left vacant for too long, and that's not an issue that can be solved by hitting tenants up for more money.' Mr Cutcher added: 'Households who are entering social housing tenancy are facing a number of challenges, and one of those challenges is necessarily a financial one. 'And to place an additional financial burden on people under those circumstances should be a difficult decision for a minister to make.' Ned Cutcher, policy officer at the NSW Tenants' Union, said public housing tenants were already liable if they caused damage to properties .

England were level with 27 minutes of the game gone as Chelsea midfielder Jodie Brett found the back of the net before Flint grabbed her first goal of the game. City striker Flint scored her second and third goals of the game in between two Leah Williamson penalties. It was 7-1 with less than 60 minutes of the game gone as Sarah Mayling and Katie Zelem got themselves on the score sheet. Williamson duly converted her second penalty of the match when Amy McGivern saw red and substitute Millie Turner capped off a sensational performance when she grabbed England's ninth in added time.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"For former Ole Miss star Marshall Henderson, revenge is a dish best served cold. The ex-college player was mocked for his alleged drug use by Erin Andrews on Twitter two years ago. But he has had the last laugh, after he jumped on revelations the TV reporter's boyfriend, Los Angeles Kings player Jarret Stoll, was busted in Las Vegas last week, accused of tying to smuggle cocaine and MDMA, or 'molly', into the MGM Grand hotel. He tweeted  the former Dancing With The Stars contestant on Monday saying: 'lol wassup with your boyfriend.' Revenge: Former Ole Miss star Marshall Henderson jumped on the revelations Jarret Stoll (right) was arrested in a drugs bust last week by tweeting to Erin Andrews: 'lol wassup with your boyfriend.' He was suspended in 2013 for allegedly failing a drugs test. Andrews responded to the news then by saying: 'He mocking anyone now?' She was referencing his reputation of being a hothead and badmouthing other players. Henderson responded with the message: 'ima save that and you will be the first person ill mock.' He has waited two years to get his revenge. On Monday TMZ sports reported that the athlete was trying to smuggle over three grams of cocaine and over eight grams of MDMA by hiding them in his board shorts. Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident. His reaction came two years after the TV reporter said: 'He mocking anyone now?' after he was suspended for failing a drugs test. He warned the ex-Dancing With The Stars contestant she was in the firing line . After learning of Stoll's arrest, he posted this on Twitter to Andrews - getting his revenge two years on . Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage, was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday after posting $5,000 bail. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. Michael Pariente, a Las Vegas criminal defense lawyer, says that Stoll will likely be offered a plea deal as a first time offender. Speaking with TSN, he said; 'It's pretty much a slap on the wrist. Even if he was going to represent himself they'd make him an offer like this.' This would include a $1,000 fee, an online drug awareness course, and possibly community service. Henderson is currently playing in Baghdad in the Iraqi Super League. His history with cocaine and marijuana use led to him being undrafted by the NBA in 2014.

The Russian man, who was filming a documentary in snow-covered mountains, found himself injured and unable to continue the ascent. It is believed the man, whose nickname is 'Che', was struck by a huge falling icicle, causing a collection of blood under the skin called a haemotoma. The blood formed a clot which caused a huge swelling and bruising, leaving him in pain and unable to walk. Scroll down for video:\\xa0VIEWERS MUST BE AWARE THE FOOTAGE CONTAINS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC CONTENT . A Russian hiker performed surgery on himself at the top of some snow-covered mountains using only items in his first aid kit . The man was struck by a falling icicle (he is pictured pointing to it with his stick) which caused a blood clot and a swelling in his leg which left him unable to walk . In order to get back down to the city at the foot of the mountains, he decided to perform surgery on himself while lying in the snow. Speaking in Russian in the video, he said: ‘If you mountain climb, fish or hunt, you must be ready for difficulties and think of safety. 'The insignificant trauma can cause serious problems if you don’t take the right actions.’ Carrying out the operation - with some surgical instruments he had in his backpack - was ‘the most reasonable and effective action’, he said. Viewers must be aware the footage contains extremely graphic content. First, he decides to use snow as an anaesthetic, and rubs it on his leg to numb the injury. Then, he burns a scalpel on a gas torch in order to make it sterile. ‘Now it is possible to start the operation,’ he explains in the video. In the original film, which has been edited by MailOnline, the man is seen making a deep incision into his leg with a scalpel, and blood is seen flowing out. He reaches into the cut with his fingers and scoops out the coagulated blood – almost black in colour – which had formed into a clot. With no sign of pain – or any emotion at all – he says: ‘As you can see here it isn’t necessary for special anaesthesia, snow perfectly coped with this task.’ He cleans away all the clotted blood, until fresh, red blood is seen. He then pours hydrogen peroxide on the wound to clean it, which fizzes and clears away the blood. Hydrogen peroxide is commonly used as an antiseptic. The man decided to perform a procedure to remove the blood clot himself, rubbing snow on his leg as an anaesthetic . He used items in his first aid kit which included a gas lamp, a scalpel, surgical string, a needle holder and a curved needle as well as a hydrogen peroxide antiseptic . ‘We consider that a tiny wound, we will sew it up now,’ he said after wiping the cut clean with a tissue. Using some surgical string, a needle holder and a curved needle, he then sews up the wound, creating large, rustic-looking stitches. Once again, he comments on how remarkably unpainful the whole procedure has been. ‘It is worth noticing that anaesthesia by means of snow is very effective. Pain isn’t felt,’ he tells the camera. Wrapping a bandage around the wound, he stamps his leg on the snow to indicate he can walk again. ‘Operation is finished,’ he declares. He cuts a deep incision in his own leg using a scalpel, which he sterilised by heating it with a gas lamp . Using his own hands he scoops out blood which has coagulated and formed a clot, before sewing the wound up with surgical string . Incredibly, ten days later the seams were removed and the wound healed completely, leaving barely any scar . Two weeks later, he is seen casually sitting on an armchair in the snow, having completely recovered. ‘I didn’t die of gangrene,’ he exclaims, adding that wound did not become infected and there was no need to discharge any pus from it. Incredibly, the seams were removed in ten days and the wound healed completely. The camera pans in on his leg and, amazingly, he was left with barely any scar. While others may have waxed lyrical about their ordeal, his concluding thoughts are that it is essential to have a surgical needle in one’s backpack. ‘It is possible to use a sharp penknife instead of a scalpel and flat nose pliers instead of a needle-holder,’ he said. ‘But unfortunately it is difficult to replace a surgical needle with something else so I advise having it in the first-aid kit.’\",\n",

Jordan Meikle stretches his muscles in front of the spectator's barriers at the London Marathon . Biding his time while masking the slight smirk on his face, Jordan lunges into another stretch – one that has him facing his girlfriend on one knee – and reveals the ring box from behind his back. His girlfriend, Kayleigh Harris appears speechless by the sudden gesture and stands back in shock as Jordan beams up at her.

The Fulton County medical examiner's office identified the woman as 25-year-old Alexia Christian. The incident happened on Thursday afternoon near the Fulton County Courthouse in downtown Atlanta. Major Darin Schierbaum said police were investigating a call about a stolen car when the two officers saw Christian sitting inside the vehicle in a parking deck. Scroll down for video . Christian was killed by police after she allegedly opened fire on them while sitting in the back of a cop car near the Fulton County Courthouse in downtown Atlanta on Thursday . At one point Christian fired at least two shots at the officers, and they returned fire, critically wounding her . Schierbaum said Christian was taken into custody and placed in a patrol car. He said that at one point she fired at least two shots at the officers, and they returned fire, fatally wounding her. Witnesses told\\xa0AJC.com,\\xa0people were startled by the gunfire\\xa0near the downtown intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and Pryor Street. Tressa Madden, who was trying to cross the street at the time, said: 'We heard three shots. 'We heard three more shots and everybody ran back across the street.' She said she saw an officer fire his weapon but could not see who it was aimed at. Another witness, Valencia Riden said she heard several shots as she approached the intersection, but wasn't sure where the shots were being fired. 'We just took off running,' she said. First responders performed CPR before an ambulance arrived, reports Channel 2. She was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital but died from her injuries. Eyewitnesses said Christian had been handcuffed and must have somehow got one hand free to fire a gun. Schierbaum said it was unclear how she was able to fire a gun while in the patrol car and that police are investigating whether she had been handcuffed. Photos from the scene show a pair of handcuffs on the trunk of the squad car. Department spokesman Greg Lyon confirmed the two officers weren't injured. At a press conference last night, he said: 'Atlanta police commanders wanted to release information as quickly as it could be confirmed. 'We owe it to the people we serve to be as transparent as we can in these types of situations.' Police are now looking for surveillance footage from the surrounding area.

Shanghai arrived with a bang in Formula One and while races in recent seasons haven't quite had the same excitement seen during its early years, there is enough substance for it to be an intriguing watch on race day. For instance whether the Chinese Grand Prix is held as a potential title decider late on in the year (2004-2008) or as an early opener (2009-present) it can often be hit with outside variables; wet conditions often sprinkling some unpredictability over a weekend. The track layout is also a challenging design. Herman Tilke ensures he gets his long straight and hairpin turn in, but it flows like Malaysia and offers great reward for getting the line through the sequence of fast turns spot on, in the middle of the lap especially. A decent run out on to the back straight is a catalyst for the classic trademark move going into the penultimate corner. Even the pit lanes can be challenging (you'll see if you scroll down) which brings us nicely on to the latest in\\xa0Sportsmail's series of Grand Prix memories... The Shanghai circuit held the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix in 2004 and has been home to the event ever since. Here is a picture shortly before its first race, with the grandstand and pit straight seen towards the back. It sure seems a long walk from the huge car park... Ricardo Zonta featured late on in the 2004 season, and is pictured in his Toyota during qualifying with the main grandstand in the background. The Brazilian had replaced the sacked Cristiano da Matta but this would be his penultimate race start in Formula One . Having been dropped by BAR for 2004, there was plenty of attention on Jacques Villeneuve when he returned to the F1 grid for the Chinese Grand Prix. In his traditional baggy overalls, the 1997 world champion poses with team boss Flavio Briatore having joined Renault for the final three races of the season following the team's dismissal of Jarno Trulli . The cameras are all on Villenueve as he emerges from the garage for his first Renault run, but the gamble to hire the Canadian backfired as he failed to score a single point for the team who would lose out to BAR in the fight for second in the constructors' championship . What's up, Fernando?! Jaguar's Mark Webber, Toyota's Olivier Panis and BAR's Takuma Sato all take a moment to wave to the Shanghai crowd in 2004, but Alonso looks far from amused with his shades on and a glum looking face to match . Given the dominance of Ferrari at the time, very few would have guessed that Rubens Barrichello's 2004 win would be his last for the team. At least he looks like he is making the most of it as he celebrates with Kimi Raikkonen, with the Finn finishing third behind Jenson Button . In a totally bizarre incident, Michael Schumacher steps out his wreck of a Ferrari which rests on the side of the track. The German collided with Christijan Albers' Minardi while driving out the pit-lane to the grid before the start of the 2005 race - both would compete in a spare car . It's all smiles at Renault as they celebrate clinching the constructors' title in the last race of the 2005 season ahead of McLaren. It capped off a perfect year for the team with Fernando Alonso (centre) becoming world champion and Giancarlo Fisichella (holding trophy aloft) proving a capable rear gunner as they recaptured success not seen since the team's previous incarnation as Benetton in 1995 . The 2005 race in Shanghai also proved to be the end of an era as the popular underdogs Minardi raced for the final time. Team boss Paul Stoddart proudly holds off a pit board showing their record of 340 races since 1985 alongside team staff and drivers Robert Doornbos (left) and Christijan Albers. Thankfully the team remained in the sport and survive to this day in its current guise as Toro Rosso . It wasn't just Minardi departing in 2005 as Jordan would also race for the final time before becoming Force India. But Narain Karthikeyan would only last 28 laps before an accident ended his race. Here, race winner Fernando Alonso zips past in his Renault, with the Indian driver seen in his yellow overalls observing the wreckage on the opposite side of the track . Shanghai in 2006 provided one of its most dramatic races. Fernando Alonso was in control before his decision to pit for scrubbed front intermediate tyres would come back to haunt him. The Spaniard was in a title fight with Michael Schumacher who, in the background, quickly caught the struggling Renault. Gianarclo Fisichella tries to provide a protective barrier to his team-mate, but so slow was Alonso that even the Italian had to pass him - with Schumacher soon following . Schumcaher would also go on to pass Fisichella and claim a very famous victory which saw the title race swing dramatically in the favour of the Ferrari star. The agony and ecstasy from the Renault and Ferrari drivers on the podium tells its own story with Alonso and Fisichella looking devastated and puzzled at how they lost the race . With his Ferrari team right behind him, Schumacher celebrates his unlikely win in parc ferme. The German's record in the Chinese Grand Prix was otherwise poor this race aside, but his famous 2006 victory would be his 91st and final Grand Prix victory in his career . Just when you thought 2006 couldn't be beaten, the following year's grand prix served up one of the pivotal  moments of the 2007 season. Rookie Lewis Hamilton tried to drag a set of beaten up intermediate tyres as long as he could around the circuit and did the hard bit by staying on the road. But when coming to pit in for new rubber, he somehow beached his McLaren in a gravel trap. Here the Brit reacts to a horrendous error with a marshall offering assistance. The right rear tyre shows just how little rubber was left on his tyre as he pitted . In a double blow for Hamilton, it was title rival Kimi Raikkonen who would benefit as the Ferrari star would go on to win the race and eventually the championship later on in the season by just one point. The Finn is shown a board to let him know he is starting his final lap . But Lewis would bounce back in 2008 as he sussed out the correct route to the pit-lane and in doing so found the key to grabbing victory. Here, the McLaren driver celebrates his win with his mother Carmen Lockhart and his step mother Linda Hamilton in parc ferme . Hide and seek Formula One style? No, it's just Nico Rosberg trying to push his Williams out of the tyre barrier following a crash during Saturday practice ahead of the 2009 race . Get out of the spray! As the safety car prepares to come in during 2009, Sebastian Vettel leads the pack in his Red Bull with team-mate Mark Webber, the Brawns of Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button, and the Toyota of Jarno Trulli seeking a line on the track where they are not blinded by spray on a wet afternoon in Shanghai . Spray would prove no problem for Vettel, who punches the air with delight after securing Red Bull's first ever win in 2009 much to the joy of team members on the pit wall. The race was the first year in which the grand prix was hosted earlier in the season where it remains . Sebastien Buemi suffered a terrifying crash just shy of 200mph during the first practice session ahead of the 2010 event, as flying down the long back straight both of his front wheels simultaneously broke off leaving him without any steering and just rear brakes to stop. Thankfully a large run off area and a gravel trap left him enough room to significantly reduce his speed before he slid along a barrier coming to a safe stop . Two fantastic drivers of their respective generations duel at the hairpin on the back straight, but sadly the best of Michael Schumacher (left) had long since passed as McLaren's Lewis Hamilton prepares to drive round the outside of the Mercedes star in 2010 . But it was Hamilton's team-mate Jenson Button who would claim 2010 victory - with the duo exchanging a warm hand-shake on the podium . Hamilton was shaking more hands a year later but this time it was as the grand prix winner, as Red Bull's Mark Webber, who finished third, greets the McLaren driver in parc ferme after the race. The triumph made Hamilton the first multi-time winner at Shanghai . Nico Rosberg leads the pack out of the first twisty opening section in front of Mercedes team-mate Michael Schumacher as McLaren's Jenson Button follows in third. Rosberg would go on to win the 2012 race which would be his first in his Formula One career . Mercedes team members rush to the pit-wall to greet Rosberg on his victory, which was the first for the team since 1955. Mercedes had only re-entered F1 as a team again in 2010 after taking over from the one-season wonders Brawn - who had previously been Honda . Fernando Alonso leads the celebrations as he holds a Ferrari flag in front of his delighted team following his 2013 win. The Spaniard looked like he could lead a Ferrari title fight following this victory, but he has only won one grand prix since. Can you name where and when it was? (Answer is at the bottom of the page) The story of 2014?

Sorry, but it’s true. With a few exceptions, you don’t get the better opportunities. You get the football version of mopping up the toilets. Chris Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, is a classic example. Ramsey is a fine coach who has been overlooked for countless jobs. Chris Ramsey (right) and Kevin Hitchcock watch QPR hammer West Brom to keep their survival hopes alive . Ramsey takes nots during his side's biggest win of the season which gave their survival chances a boost . He took the QPR position after Harry Redknapp, a talented, experienced manager with a good track record of rescuing clubs in trouble, saw the writing on the wall and got out. Ramsey was asked to board the sinking ship and, guess what, it has not been an easy job to refloat it. Before the victory at West Brom, QPR were sliding deeper into trouble and there were already those seeking to blame it on Ramsey. Just as predictably, there were also those saying Ramsey’s struggles were an indication black managers tend to fail on the rare occasions they are given a chance. John Barnes' troubled reign at Celtic ended after an infamous Scottish Cup defeat by Inverness Caley Thistle . If Ramsey is sacked, people will say it was about results, not race. And they will be wrong. Because race was why he had to take the job in the first place. People tend not to like inconvenient truths about why there are so few black managers in the English game. Some got angry again when John Barnes suggested a manager on a bad run will get sacked sooner if he’s black. He was right. The fact Ramsey has been labouring to turn things around at QPR does not mean he is not a good manager. It just means that when your only chance in the game is to accept a hospital pass, the odds are you’re going to get hurt.\",\n",

The Italian champions were kept informed even though no formal offer has yet been made to the club for the France international. Pogba and his representatives are understood to have met PSG president Nasser Al Khelaifi in Monte Carlo on Tuesday. When asked the president replied told French press: 'Why did I meet with Pogba? Because he’s a great talent, he’s French and he’s from Paris. That said, all the big clubs want him.' Barcelona have also shown an intention to bid for Pogba. Their transfer embargo however means a deal would be agreed where the player remains in Turin until next January. Paris Saint-Germain have opened primary discussions with Paul Pogba over a possible move from Juventus . PSG striker Edinson Cavani has a meeting scheduled with his brother and agent on Wednesday as he discusses his options. PSG do not wish to sell the striker but Cavani is intrigued by calls from Juventus. Atletico Madrid have also expressed an interest with Mario Mandzukic weighing up offers from England. PSG striker Edinson Cavani is considering his options and could be set for a move away from Paris . Sevilla are weighing up a return for Manchester City winger Jesus Navas. The 29-year-old has had a decent run in City's first team of late but overall has been disappointing since his £15million transfer from Sevilla in 2013. Navas has had his family around him in Manchester, including his brother Marco playing briefly for Bury, yet he is understood to be interested in a return to Spain. Finance will be a stumbling block even though Sevilla are challenging to qualify for the Champions League. They will not be able to match Navas's wages and would offer around £7million. Sevilla are weighing up a move for Manchester City's 29-year-old winger Jesus Navas . Yaya Toure remains Inter Milan's main transfer target for the summer despite the obvious financial difficulties of signing a 31-year-old player on £200,000 a week. They have drawn up a provisional back-up list which as reported previously in Sportsmail includes Alex Song of Barcelona and Lucas Leiva of Liverpool. Another player who has come into their reckoning though is Udinese's Allan Marques Loureiro. The 24-year-old Brazilian is a box to box midfielder and also has a Portuguese passport. Song, on loan at West Ham, also has interest from AC Milan. The Rossoneri could be in new ownership soon as Silvio Berlusconi will meet with prospective buyer Bee Taechaubol tonight. Inter are continuing to work on a loan deal for Stevan Jovetic at City too. City midfielder Yaya Toure (left) remains Inter Milan's main transfer target for the summer . Stoke have made an enquiry about Dnipro flyer Yevhen Konoplyanka. The Ukraine winger was the subject of a failed bid from Liverpool over a year ago but will be out of contract in the summer. Tottenham had a deal in place earlier this year but that has now been shelved while Everton also wanted to sign him. The 25-year-old has been offered £2.5million a year tax free by Turkish side Galatasaray yet is keen on a move to the Premier League or Italy where Roma have the strongest interest. Stoke are unlikely to be his destination but they are showing ambition in their moves this window and want to inject pace with their latest signings. They have held talks about a £4m deal for Evian's Daniel Wass, 25, and asked about Yannick Bolasie of Crystal Palace. Stoke also had scouts at Le Havre last weekend to watch defender Ferland Mendy, 19, who has interest from Sampdoria, Sporting Braga, Standard Liege and Basle too. Stoke have made an enquiry about Yevhen Konoplyanka (left), who will be out of contract this summer . Everton have interest from clubs in midfielder Mohamed Besic. The 22-year-old German-born Bosnia international has shown glimpses of his potential this season following his £4.8m arrival from Ferencvaros last summer. He also impressed at the World Cup in Brazil. Besic has picked up 11 yellow cards and can tread a fine line disciplinary-wise at times but Everton are keen to keep him. Roberto Martinez is a confirmed fan but the fact Besic has not started regularly has prompted clubs to check whether there is potential to strike a deal. Everton are looking for another midfielder, two forwards and a left-sided centre-back. They have also checked on Aberdeen's promising midfielder Ryan Jack, 23. Interest from Arsenal and Tottenham also remains in James McCarthy but his price tag or Everton's reluctance to listen to offers will make that difficult. 22-year-old Everton midfielder Mohamed Besic has been attracting interest from European clubs . Real Madrid may need to pay Iker Casillas £10million to leave. The future of the 33-year-old goalkeeper is under scrutiny every day and his form has not been what is should be. That has prompted more calls for Madrid to bring in David de Gea from Manchester United but first Casillas would need to move on. He is contracted until 2017 and earns around £5.75m a year. In terms of recognition for his service, his advisers would push for the club to pay him his outstanding salary on the contract. Real Madrid could end up paying veteran goalkeeper Iker Casillas £10million to leave the club . David de Gea is tempted by a return to Madrid but has still to decisively make up his mind on when that should be. Although Arsenal have been linked with Casillas, there are reservations about his form, something that has also been questioned within the Madrid dressing room. MLS sides and those in the Middle East have shown an interest in Casillas should he opt to go. Key for Madrid, and United, is that any impending transfer ban will either accelerate decisions to buy or put blocks on sales. David de Gea is tempted with a move to Madrid, but could yet stay loyal to Manchester United . Crystal Palace and West Brom have shown an interest in Montpellier defender Daniel Congre. Congre, 30, can play at right-back, centre-back and left-back. He could be available for a cut-price deal of just £1.4m. The defender is currently considering a contract extension from the Ligue 1 outfit. Crystal Palace and West Brom have shown an interest in Montpellier defender Daniel Congre (left) Bradford City striker Billy Clarke is a man in demand this summer.

              " {'sequence': \"The official word from Arsenal is that Jack Wilshere is not for sale at the end of the season. Not to Manchester City, not to anyone. Wilshere is one of Arsenal’s own, a product of the fabled Hale End academy and an example to young recruits that it is possible to make a first-team breakthrough. The reality is that Wilshere will sit with his influential father, Andy, at the end of the season to discuss whether a move to City would enhance his career and not just his bank balance. Jack Wilshere takes on Stoke's Charlie Ward during the Arsenal U21s game at the Emirates on Tuesday night . Wilshere was making his first appearance for the Gunners since recovering from ankle surgery . Wilshere has not featured for the first team since he was injured against Manchester United on November 22 . The England midfielder lays on the Old Trafford turf dejected after he suffered an ankle injury . Whatever manager Arsene Wenger has to say before Arsenal’s clash with Burnley on Saturday, Wilshere to Manchester City, as revealed in Sportsmail on Wednesday, is undoubtedly in the works. He is on the list of Txiki Begiristain, City’s director of football. At 23, he is a young English player who could bring down the average age of this City squad — if they could prise him from the Emirates. It will not be easy. Wilshere has always maintained that he wants to remain at Arsenal for the rest of his career. City, though, offer a fresh start and it is possible that Wilshere needs a change of environment after another frustrating season on the sidelines. England manager Roy Hodgson has preferred to deploy Wilshere in a defensive role for the national team . Manchester City have snapped up several players from Arsenal in recent times, with varying degrees of success. GAEL CLICHY . Transfer fee: £7m. Arsenal: 1 Premier League title (2003-04), 1 FA Cup (2005). Man City: 2 Premier League titles (2011-12, 13-14), 1 League Cup (2014). Verdict: Decent deal . KOLO TOURE . Fee: £15m. Arsenal: 1 Premier League title (2003-04), 2 FA Cups (2003, 2005). Man City: 1 Premier League title (2011-12), 1 FA Cup (2011). Verdict: Decent deal . EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR . Fee: £25m. Arsenal honours: none. Man City honours: none. Verdict: bad buy . SAMIR NASRI . Fee: £24m. Arsenal: none. Man City: 2 Premier League titles (2011-12, 2013-14), 1 League Cup (2014). Verdict: top transfer . BACARY SAGNA . Fee: free. Arsenal: 1 FA Cup (2014). Man City: none. Verdict: decent deal . It is also a well-trodden path for Arsenal players in recent seasons, with Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Bacary Sagna leaving the rhythmic, first-touch football at the Emirates for super-sized salaries at City. It is not an easy decision, particularly with the vulgar salaries on offer at the Etihad and the inevitable accusations of being a mercenary, but this is key moment in Wilshere’s career. The midfielder is already paid handsomely — £130,000 a week all in when he starts for Arsenal — but injuries are a constant source of frustration for Wilshere. He has not played a first-team game for Arsenal since November 22, when he was substituted 55 minutes into the 2-1 defeat by Manchester United at the Emirates with an ankle injury. In the past, Wilshere has been built up too soon, championed as a future Arsenal and England captain when he has yet to even make 100 starts for his club in the Barclays Premier League. Even former England captain Steven Gerrard claimed he had the ability to become one of the best midfielders in the world before he played Brazil at Wembley in February 2013. ‘Jack’s got a bit of everything. He can tackle, pass, get up and down the pitch, create a goal or score a goal,’ said Gerrard at the time. ‘He ticks almost every box, and he’s going to get better and better. He has the potential to become one of the best in the world. ‘I don’t want to put any pressure on him, but having played against him and seen him in training, he’s a one-off. He’s a lot better than your normal Premier League midfielder.’ The truth is that Wilshere needs time, room to breathe again after being championed ever since he scored that magnificent goal for Arsenal’s reserve team against West Ham at Barnet’s Underhill Stadium in 2008. Wenger was there that night, grinning with approval in the stands after the 16-year-old’s curling left-foot effort confirmed his status as one of the club’s rising stars. He earned instant comparison to Liam Brady. Gael Clichy (left) and Samir Nasri are just two Gunners who have left for Manchester City in recent seasons . Arsene Wenger's side are currently second in the Premier League and face Burnley on Saturday . Since then Wilshere has made the grade with the first team, an established member of a core group of players who are enjoying the club’s soothing possession football. On present form Arsenal are the best team to watch in the Premier League and Wilshere, recovering from his latest injury, would dearly love to be part of it. Although dad Andy is a West Ham fan, his son is Arsenal through and through, as he demonstrated after last season’s dramatic victory over Hull City in the FA Cup. During the victory parade, just hours before he joined up with the England squad to begin preparations for the World Cup in Brazil, he mischievously grabbed the microphone to ask the fans: ‘What do you think of Tottenham?’ The answer was well-publicised at the time, but the more pertinent question is whether Wilshere can reclaim his first place in this developing Arsenal team. Wilshere could struggle to break into a side containing Alexis Sanchez (left) and Mesut Ozil next season . With England, manager Roy Hodgson plays him at the base of his midfield diamond, but at Arsenal Wenger prefers him in a pairing behind the main attackers. With Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey the favoured attacking players behind Olivier Giroud, this is not an easy team for Wilshere to get into next season. At 23 he has time on his side and even at the end of this season there are still three years to run on his current contract. Soon enough there will be a decision to be made for all concerned.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"'You're getting the hang of this commentary lark,' cooed Martin Tyler during Sky Sports coverage of the Manchester derby. Tyler was, of course, one half of the commentary team that was once seen as being the best of the bunch. That other half back then being his old partner Andy Gray. Nowadays, the man in the gantry alongside him is Gary Neville. And it was his zinger after United's fourth goal –\\xa0'Smalling has scored. It's a mauling for City' –\\xa0that got the veteran lip mic man reaching for the platitudes. And perhaps cementing the new best partnership in the process? I'm not sure if Neville actually carries his recently won Royal Television Society Pundit of the Year award around with him? He could probably just about squeeze the perspex trophy into his inside jacket pocket if he really fancied it, but I doubt he would because I think one thing you could never accuse Neville of being is one of the extroverts among the current batch of experts. Gary Neville  in the Sky Sports studio after co-commentating with Martin Tyler for the Manchester derby . Chris Smalling is pictured scoring for Manchester United as City goalkeeper Joe Hart sees it go in . United defender Smalling was an unlikely goalscorer against City and Neville had a zinger to match it . Co-commentator Neville analysed the goal by saying: 'Smalling has scored. It's a mauling for City' Nevertheless, on his return to his old stamping ground with that new title attached, it was good to see him to turn it on even just a bit. And put in a performance that fitted both his newly anointed status and the magnitude of the occasion. Neville was all over this thrilling derby right from the get go. 'We've got a proper game of football here,' he extolled early on, almost licking his lips at the prospect. He was also quick to point out what he saw as the 'graveyard' of City's right-hand side as United punished them time and time again along the hosts' attacking left. The razor-edged corner of tongue was saved not exclusively, but certainly frequently for Yaya Toure's performance. Time and time again Gary found himself talking about the various patches of grass in which he felt Yaya should be but very rarely was. And when co-commentator Tyler did observe that he could see Toure finally picking up his man, Neville snorted his retort. 'That's nice of him.' He was in equally abrupt mood after the game when he joined Niall Quinn and Graeme Souness for what was a really sharp, incisive and no-holds-barred post-match discussion. Time and time again Neville found himself analysing Yaya Toure's poor performance for City . Toure could do little for City as they suffered a 4-2 defeat by their great rivals United at Old Trafford . Neville (right)and\\xa0Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher form a dynamic Monday Night Football duo . Here Toure carried on getting it from Gary - who referred to the 'dereliction of duty' in his performance before adding that Yaya's recent form was: 'Not a conundrum anymore. He cannot do his job. Simple as that.' What's more, he was equally gobsmacked by Yaya's team-mates' lack of urgency when Aguero scored a late second. 'I can't quite work out whether to get a little bit wound up by this? I'm looking at their reaction. Is that right?' he asked. However, let's not assume this criticism is all because Gary is simply red. On discussing City's immediate Financial Fair Play-affected future, he made it quite clear where he stands. 'I'm a Manchester United fan,' he pointed out, pointlessly. 'But the last thing I want to see is Manchester City dip back down again to the second or third division because they can't challenge because there's some restrictive rule in place. 'We don't want a Real Madrid-Barcelona. We want competition.' Neville was damning in his analysis of City and freely admits he is a United fan after his years of service . Neville was gobsmacked by the City players' lack of urgency when Sergio Aguero (above) scored a second . This turned out to be not only the right moment, but also the right kind of game to make that point. Early in the coverage, host Ed Chamberlain told us 'the eyes of the football world' were watching. Over shots of a touchline teeming with camera crews, he went on to inform us there were '22 broadcasters here' and that the game was 'being beamed to over 100.' Sky Sports then went on to present those broadcasters with exemplary game coverage coupled with some lovely vignettes of the occasion. As well as a close up of the deep set, brooding eyes of Manuel Pellegrini that may haunt me for a fortnight. All in all, it was great coverage of a great game in a genuinely great league. As confirmed by a ton of countries, and Manchester's own Gary Neville.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"On February 14, 1998, new kid on the block Michael Owen scored a hat-trick for Liverpool in a 3-3 draw with Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. Doing so on the most romantic day of the year was fitting for the division's newest heartthrob. The expectation surrounding Owen escalated, and the intro for the next day's report in the Liverpool Echo said it all: 'Brazil have Ronaldo. Liverpool, and now England, have Michael Owen.' Michael Owen was the new kid on the block in the Premier League and scored three at Hillsborough in 1998 . Owen celebrates as he scores his hat-trick against Sheffield Wednesday on February 14, 1998 . England's young striker Owen makes a run during the 1998 World Cup against Argentina in France . Owen lets rip his shot that saw the Three Lions starlet score against Argentina at the 1998 World Cup .

Best ever  season total:19 . 2014-15: 26 appearances, 19 goals . 2015-16: TBC . Best ever season total: 19 (and counting) It was a lot for young shoulders to take, yet four-and-a-half months later he scored that goal against Argentina at France '98. He handled it. Other England strikers created a similar hype. Wayne Rooney was one, Alan Shearer another. And now Harry Kane is dividing opinion. Some believe he will be the next name jotted on that prestigious list, others think he will be found out. This is where Kane can take note of Owen. It was he who, in 1997-98, scored 18 goals in 36 appearances in the Barclays Premier League. He kept it up at the 1998 World Cup, and did so the season after, too, scoring 18 goals again but in six fewer Premier League appearances. He never looked at the opposition as Manchester United, or Arsenal, or even Argentina. 'From one game to the next, I didn't even know who I was playing against – they were just names on a teamsheet, not big reputations, and that innocence served me well,' Owen once said. Kane has been just as fearless this year. The expectation on him is up there with Owen, and Rooney, and Shearer. Yet he must, at the very least, do it for another season; prove it is not a fluke, or a one-off, before he can even be considered a reason for England supporters to be chipper. Harry Kane came on as a substitute to make his senior England debut by replacing Wayne Rooney . Kane celebrates scoring for England during his senior debut at Wembley against Luthuania . Kane will try to prove his outstanding Premier League season is not a fluke this year . 3\\xa0- no player had ever won Player of the Month three times in a row... but Kane tied with Dennis Bergkamp and Cristiano Ronaldo after winning it in January and February . 19 - Kane has matched Owen's best-ever total for a Premier League season . 22\\xa0- Kane's 19 goals have directly contributed 22 points to Tottenham Hotspur's 56 total . 25 - Kane has won the same amount of tackles as Vincent Kompany this season . 40 - Kane's 22 goals in 40 appearances in the Premier League beats Owen's 20 . 500 - Kane was 500/1 to be win the Premier League Golden Boot this season . Even so, that does not mean he shouldn't be celebrated, or that he can't do it. Kane, after all, has matched Owen's 19 goals in 2001-02 and 2002-03 – the BT Sport\\xa0co-commentator’s best-ever total in a Premier League season – with eight games to spare. His 22 goals in his first 40 appearances beats Owen’s 20, too. Kane's goals have contributed 22 points to Tottenham Hotspur alone, taking them from a losing position to a winning one against Leicester City, Queens Park Rangers, Arsenal, and so on. They’d be 14th without. Nobody, by the way, had ever won the Player of the Month award three consecutive times. Dennis Bergkamp won it in August and September, 1997. Cristiano Ronaldo won it in November and December, 2006. Kane went desperately close to a third following five goals in March, only for Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud to deny him. Even so, being mentioned in the same breath as Bergkamp and Ronaldo will do the man who was struggling for a place in the Leicester City team just two years ago. Kane celebrates scoring against Queens Park Rangers for Tottenham in the Premier League at Loftus Road . Kane went desperately close to a third straight Player of the Month award - which has never been done before . Harry Kane and Vincent Kompany have – coincidentally –\\xa0played 1,876 minutes each this season, and here's how they compare: . Tackles won: . 25 - Kane . 25 - Kompany . Tackles lost: . 30 - Kane . 37 - Kompany . The Tottenham product – 6ft 2in with hair slicked back and a traditional look about him – seems an old-fashioned centre forward. He was 500/1 at the beginning of the season to win the Premier League Golden Boot, and is not just another also-ran. In Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero, he is rivalling one man who cost Chelsea £32million, and another who won Manchester City the title three years ago. Analysing his style of play, however, isn't easy. He isn't known for having pace like Owen, or a cannon of a right foot like Shearer, or dribbling like Aguero, or a bravado like Costa –\\xa0yet Kane appears a Jack of all trades. Ten goals with his right foot, five with his left, four with his head – he’s a right-place-at-the-right-time kind of striker, which never hurts. He’s precise, too, having had the third-most shots on target in the Premier League this year, behind Aguero and Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin.

Kane's heat maps against Leicester City (left) and Arsenal (right) show he's active in both halves . And don’t forget persistent. Consider the top 20 most distances covered by players during a Premier League match, and Kane features twice (13.01km vs Everton, and 13.12km vs Swansea City). It's no wonder his heat maps (above) show him active from one half to the other. Even chanelling his inner defender, Kane has made as many tackles (25) as Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany this season in the same amount of minutes (1,876) – and has lost fewer. Yet Italy proved more difficult to handle than Lithuania, or Leicester, or QPR. Kane was given a hard time by Giorgio Chiellini – a foul after 19 seconds serving as an unofficial welcome to international football – but he has had that treatment before. Not by the Italian, but by Chelsea captain John Terry. The Capital One Cup final at Wembley was among his more difficult afternoons, Kane admitted in an exclusive interview with Sportsmail previously, and it will only get harder. Kane was closely marked by Italy's Giorgio Chiellini in what was a taster of what's to come from defenders . Chiellini often had his arms wrapped around Kane during set pieces in England's friendly with Italy in Turin . Kane was barely given an inch by Chiellini during the international friendly and he can expect it to continue . Defenders catch on quick, and he will be marked intensely, as per Chiellini and Terry’s taster. Can his remarkable form continue for another season, and the one after that, and so on? Kane must avoid what happened to Michael Ricketts – a player who fell off the radar almost as quickly as he came on to it. Ricketts hit 12 goals for Bolton Wanderers in his first Premier League season by February 2002 to earn his England debut against Holland that same month, yet the striker did not score for  the rest of the season and never reached double figures for a club in the league again. What Kane doesn't want is to become the answer to a pub quiz question that asks which player scored 25-plus goals in 2014-15, only to never be seen again? Only he can make sure that doesn’t happen, and it begins with a half-decent 2015-16. Michael Ricketts hit 12 goals for Bolton Wanderers in his first Premier League season by February 2002 . He did not score for the rest of the season and never reached double figures for a club in the league again .

              " {'sequence': \"Tuesday night against Italy could be the most important England game Michael Carrick has ever played. The difference between the first and the second half was like night and day. When Carrick came on, England started to play. Having played in his position, and alongside him, it has been frustrating to see him unappreciated in this country. We have always had a major problem keeping the ball, but Carrick keeps the game simple. That’s exactly what we need. Roy Hodgson’s team against Italy looked like he had one eye on the future, but the only future England need to be focusing on is Euro 2016. If that means going with a 34-year-old Michael Carrick in the heart of midfield, so be it. Tuesday night's friendly clash with Italy  could prove to be Michael Carrick's most important England game . England international Carrick keeps the game simple but has been unappreciated in this country . Carrick congratulates Andros Townsend following the Tottenham wideman's equaliser against Italy in Turin . WAYNE ROONEY . ‘The best player on the pitch by a mile was Michael Carrick. He came on and dictated the game for us.’ PAUL SCHOLES (last week) ‘He is not a flash footballer. He doesn’t hit Hollywood passes. He doesn’t score lots of goals. But I loved playing alongside him.’ SIR ALEX FERGUSON (in December) ‘I still think Michael Carrick is the best central midfield player in English football, I really do. I think he is the best English player in the game.’ Even though he’s 33 now, it’s still not too late to start building the midfield around him. If I were England manager, that’s just what I’d do. Look at Andrea Pirlo — he is 36 next month and has blossomed in his later years. His passing tore England apart at the World Cup and he is worshipped in Italy. Why can’t we love Carrick in the same way? The fact he has been ignored by England for so long is a sad indictment of where we have been going wrong for so many years. In this country we tend to focus a lot on what players can’t do rather than what they can. We love all-action players like Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard but that’s why men like Carrick can be left frustrated. It was not long ago that defensive midfielders had to snap into every tackle. At Manchester United in particular, Carrick has had to deal with ‘Keane Syndrome’ — because he’s not Roy Keane. He’s not as mobile, he doesn’t grab games in the same way and he certainly doesn’t tackle like Keane. But that is not his style. Keane was an amazing player but there will never be another like him and the game has evolved.

Andrea Pirlo, who turns 36 next month, tore England apart with his passing at last summer's World Cup .

And don’t be fooled by a powerhouse like Nemanja Matic — he can pick out any kind of pass with that left foot. These aren’t just defensive destroyers any more, these are the men starting the attacks. They may not have the best stats for goals or assists, but they are at the heart of it all. It’s the same with Andres Iniesta and Luka Modric — they keep things ticking over, as does Carrick. He makes the passes that lead to the key pass. The midfield that started in Turin was powerful and athletic, but sometimes you need a bit of guile. In a way, it was a good job the first half was so poor as it meant Carrick could come on and really show what he can do. Friendlies might be a good time to experiment but that first half in Italy made for some uncomfortable viewing. Phil Jones has had a decent season at centre back but looked awkward in midfield and England’s passing was too slow and square. Carrick changed that. All of a sudden there was a different tempo to the game. England were fluid and found more room to move against a tough opponent. When he gets possession, Carrick quickly gets the ball out of his feet and tries to slide passes forward. He’s not the toughest of tacklers but he doesn’t need to be. He reads the game brilliantly and intercepts the ball so well that he doesn’t need to go charging after people. He has fantastic vision, which means his team-mates can get into dangerous positions. They know that if anyone can pick out a pass, it’s Carrick. He is so comfortable on the ball and probably England’s most two-footed player since Glenn Hoddle. He’s not in Hoddle’s class, but he is so well balanced with both feet. Carrick takes on midfield rival Roberto Soriano during England's 1-1 draw with Italy at the Juventus Stadium . Xavi and Nemanja Matic are two of the world's best deep-lying midfielders and both have an eye for a pass . Carrick's introduction against Italy changed the game, the tempo and saw England become more fluid . I’ve said it before but Carrick has a nasty habit of passing to his own players. It might not look flash but he makes the game look easy. That’s why so many of his team-mates love playing alongside him. He might be a quiet personality but you can see the effect he has on those around him. United have been far better with him than without him this season and Daley Blind, who many thought would replace him, has been shunted out of position. That’s because Carrick is a better player in that role. It’s also important to have experience in that position — I’ve never felt it’s one for a young player. Hodgson has tried Jack Wilshere but Carrick knows the role at club level. Of course Wilshere could play next to him, but at present Carrick is the best man for the job. Considering he won his first cap against Mexico in 2001, it’s amazing he has not featured more for England. He has not always taken his chances, but now is a golden opportunity to build our midfield around him. It’s still not too late to make sure England have a pass master in place for Euro 2016. Carrick, who made his debut in 2001 (right), could become England's third-longest serving player at the Euros .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'In a week where people have been highlighting the lack of young English talent in the Premier League, it’s good to see three youngsters playing in my old position have really caught the eye this season. Calum Chambers, Eric Dier and John Stones have all enjoyed excellent Premier League campaigns. Defence is not the easiest area for a young player to make an impression — managers can be reluctant to trust youth in a position of responsibility — but these three have done just that. What sets them apart is their self-belief. Chambers and Stones are still 20 and Dier is 21, but there are no signs of fear in their games. Arsenal defender Calum Chambers (left) has impressed in his first season at the club . Everton defender John Stones (right) puts in a challenge against Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge . Tottenham defender Eric Dier (left) has grown in stature as the season has progressed at White Hart Lane . In a way, we shouldn’t really be surprised. Between them they have cost £19million, so they are not exactly surprise packages. What has been surprising is the way they have come on this season. They are by no means the finished article, but their progress is encouraging. It helps that all three have had a taste of playing at full back. I think they are all destined to become top central defenders, but if you are mobile enough, you are often asked to do a job at full back. At this stage it certainly does no harm to your development. I remember playing at right back before moving to the middle. You need pace and stamina to bomb up and down but when it comes to playing at centre half, that agility can be of huge benefit. I first saw Dier playing for the England Under 20s and he still looked raw. He was a powerful, quick right back who charged up and down, but he needed more control. I felt his body type made him ideally suited to centre half and he has made that position his own at Tottenham. Dier (left) stood up strongly against Chelsea striker Diego Costa in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley . Stones has moved across from right back into the centre of defence for Everton and has flourished . His rise has been quite spectacular. He has gone from a promising squad player to a first-team regular alongside Jan Vertonghen. He moves the ball well, is technically very good and he is a fighter — he stood up well to Diego Costa in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley. The next step for him is to become a vocal leader. The best central defenders demand so much from those around them and if that mentality is drilled into him, Dier could improve Tottenham’s rather soft underbelly. Stones has spent time at right back but now finds himself at the heart of the Everton defence. He is very comfortable on the ball, has good speed and reads the game well so is rarely beaten one on one. He can tackle with either foot and his timing is excellent — just when you think he is beaten, he nicks the ball. He is comfortable playing out of defence but he has to be careful not to overplay. He is good in the air but can improve, especially from wide crosses and set-pieces. Experience will help him become more wily. With Chambers, I never doubted he was going to the right club, but I did wonder how many games he would play at Arsenal. With lots of competition for places, he has a real fight on his hands but he has already made 35 appearances this season. Of the three he is the best on the ball and if he makes a mistake, there is no drop in confidence — he still wants to make forward passes. That passing ability means there could be value in trying him in midfield, though that would require careful planning to bed him in. Chambers (right) has played at right back, centre-back and midfield for Arsenal during the season . England manager Roy Hodgson could be tempted to field the trio in a back three for the Three Lions . In one on ones, sometimes he doesn’t look set. He likes to put an arm on the attacker to slow them down and that’s partly why he has picked up eight bookings this season and been sent off. He tries to win the ball in the first few strides and can be prone to gambling. All three have taken huge steps forward this season, and with England using two centre-back partnerships in the last two games, those positions could be up for grabs. And if Roy Hodgson wants to fit more attacking players into his England side in the future, there’s no reason why this trio, with their experiences at full back, couldn’t play together in a back three. It would certainly be a useful option.',\n",

Bournemouth's promotion means Arsenal will start season in second place for the first time in 100 years . Arsenal have theoretically started each season since 1915/16 at the summit of England's top tier, although the advent of the First World War meant it was only in 1919 that the club officially began their century-old record. The Gunners only finished fifth in the last pre-war competitive season, but they were nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division after the First World War in 1919–20, at the expense of local rivals Tottenham. After Eddie Howe guided Bournemouth to within touching distance of the Promised Land on Monday with victory over Bolton, only a highly improbable goal-swing would deny them automatic promotion.

Referee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) He was then a spectator on the half hour when his international team-mate got the second climbing unmarked to head Dani Alves’ cross past Salvatore Sirigu to make it 5-1 on aggregate. PSG’s soft centre cost them in the first leg and it was cruelly exposed again. Luiz was also booked inside the first five minutes for a foul on Andres Iniesta, who ran the first half. The man who won the World Cup for Spain but is these days criticised for neither scoring nor assisting went on a sublime run for the first goal, pulling away from Edinson Cavani and swerving past Marco Verratti before releasing Neymar. The French champions thought they were back in the game between the two Barcelona goals when on 17 minutes Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside when Blaise Matuidi slipped him through and the flag was raised to rule out the goal. The Swede was jeered by Barcelona supporters in the early stages as was former Barcelona defender Maxwell but such was Barca’s dominance that home fans eased up on the light-hearted abuse. Suarez and Messi were also impressive in the first half and Alves looked like a man trying to impress a potential employer. PSG could still be a possible destination for him beyond the end of this season. He tested Sirigu from distance before his assist for Neymar’s second. With Suarez and Alves snapping into challenges and Iniesta and Neymar providing the finesse Barcelona were completely dominant – to the extent that for once Messi was not their most impressive performer. The home side eased up after the break and PSG breathed more easily without ever threatening to get back into the tie. Rakitic saw his shot saved and Messi went close with chip that Sirigu gathered.

PSG did force a save from Marc-Andre Ter Stegen 10 minutes into the second half when Ibrahimovic tried his luck from distance but the German keeper who has watched Claudio Bravo not put a foot wrong in the league all season gave another faultless display. Missing the domestic campaign has been tough but a final appearance in Berlin would be some consolation. Luis Enrique’s side were so comfortable at half-time Xavi replaced the impeccable Iniesta at the break. And it wasn’t long before Busquets and Suarez were also given early cuts. Barcelona still have a league to win and play the Catalan derby against Espanyol this weekend with sill just a narrow two point lead over Real Madrid. Iniesta had done enough in 45 minutes of football to not need to come out after half time. His performance and at times Barca’s was a throwback to some of their best football under Pep Guardiola when the won this completion in both 2009 and 2011. Iniesta was in sensational form for Barcelona before replaced at half time by veteran midfielder Xavi . Barcelona's captain had been criticised earlier this season for a lack of goals and assists but he looks to be back to his best . Guardiola was the name on most supporters lips at half time as news filtered through that Bayern were mauling Porto and were also heading for the semi-finals.

Just a couple of months after scoring a sensational first international try against New Zealand, May was axed for striking the wrong note by ignoring an overlap in England’s Six Nations win over Italy. He was told to go away and learn his lessons back at Gloucester. With a mother who taught Sheeran to play the guitar as a youngster, learning lessons has never been a problem for the 25-year-old May, who insists the best years of his rugby life are ahead of him. Jonny May will start on the wing for Gloucester at the Stoop on Friday but has lost his England starting place . He starts on the wing for Gloucester on Friday night, as David Humphreys’ men take on Edinburgh in the final of the European Challenge Cup in a bid to claim a first significant piece of silverware since winning the same competition in 2006. ‘Obviously when you get dropped it is not a nice thing but I’m trying to learn from it and turn it into a positive by becoming a better player,’ May said. ‘It’s part of what being a professional rugby player is. I’m not an old player but I’ve experienced it here, I’ve experienced bad games and made mistakes here and there. ‘There are times I’ve had bad games at Gloucester or injuries or setbacks or come across weaknesses in my game. I’ve reflected on it and come back a better player. ‘I’m 25 years old and feel like I’m still improving and progressing.’ May is comfortable in the limelight, unfazed by the big stage and even claims some responsibility for setting Sheeran on the way to global superstardom; his mum, Hazel, taught the teenager his first chords on a guitar. ‘Ed was in our network of friends, and he was into his classical music but my mum used to play guitar along with others in that circle,’ May said. ‘He saw my mum playing and wanted to learn so she taught him some chords and off he went.’ Gloucester wing Jonny May leaves the pitch injured during the first-half against Newcastle on Saturday .

The Hartpury College graduate admitted after his wonder try in the defeat to the All Blacks last November that he’d listened to Sheeran and Taylor Swift on his iPod in the build-up to the game. Hardly the conventional choice to get in the mood to play the world champions but convention is not something that unduly concerns May on or off the field. And despite the disappointment of losing his England place to Exeter’s Jack Nowell, May has no intention of becoming a conformist any time soon. ‘You can’t really be worried about messing up because that’s the last place you want to be as a player,’ he said. ‘You’ve just got to go out there and believe in what you see and do it straight away with no hesitation. It’s sport, you have bad games, get injuries and get dropped.’ Edinburgh trained at Murrayfield in Scotland ahead of facing Gloucester at the Stoop on Friday . Edinburgh will arrive at the Stoop confident of upsetting Gloucester but the Cherry and Whites are expected to have a vastly superior support with upwards of 6,000 fans expected to travel to west London on Friday night. The English side will have the added advantage of scrum-half Greig Laidlaw in their ranks — who signed from Edinburgh last season — while the addition of Wales hooker Richard Hibbard and former All Black prop John Afoa has added much-needed ballast to Gloucester’s pack. ‘To win this competition would provide the foundations to show we are up and coming and we want to improve and get better,’ May added. ‘It would give us a stepping board to progress. If we do want to be a team that is competitive in the Premiership and competitive in the upper tier of Europe I think we have the players, the fanbase and the club to be very competitive at the top of all leagues.’ Gloucester scrum-half Greig Laidlaw, in action for his current side, signed from Edinburgh last season .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Binge drinking as a teenager can cause long-lasting damage to the brain well into adulthood, a new study has warned. This is because drinking excessive amounts of alcohol when young can damage the brain and cause permanent changes to DNA. This, in turn, can put teenagers at risk of anxiety disorders and alcoholism, researchers found. Alcohol changes genes in brain cells, which stop the cells developing connections between them, altering behaviour, they said. However, they discovered a cancer drug may reverse the damage. Binge drinking as a teenager can cause long-lasting damage into adulthood, putting young people at risk of anxiety disorders and alcoholism . Professor Subhash Pandey, of the University of Illinois College of Medicine, explained that binge drinking during the teenage years disrupts the brain's normal development. He said: 'Our study provides a mechanism for how binge-drinking during adolescence may lead to lasting changes that result in increased anxiety and alcoholism in adults.' Intermittent alcohol exposure 'degrades the ability of the brain to form the connections it needs to during adolescence, he explained. 'The brain doesn't develop as it should, and there are lasting behavioural changes associated with this,' he added. As part of the study, Professor Pandey and his team carried out lab experiments on 28-day-old rats to investigate how alcohol would affect their brain development. They were given alcohol for two days on, then two days off, which was repeated over 13 days. Rats exposed to alcohol showed changes in behaviour that lasted into adulthood, long after the exposure to alcohol ended. Alcohol causes changes in the DNA in brain cells. However, researchers discovered a cancer drug may be able to reverse the changes . They showed increased anxiety-like behaviours and drank more alcohol in adulthood. When brain tissue from the area of the brain called the amygdala was examined, rats given alcohol showed changes to their DNA, known as epigenetic changes. Professor Pandey explained that epigenetic changes are chemical modifications of DNA, or of the proteins around which DNA is wound, like thread on a spool. Modification of these proteins, which are called histones, can change how loosely or tightly the DNA is wound. Many of us enjoy a chilled glass of wine or a cold beer after a hard day at work. But while the majority of people believe their drinking habits are under control, one in five young professionals now considers themselves to have a problem with alcohol, a survey found. A new poll laying bare the public's attitudes to drinking found nearly half of young workers think it is acceptable to regularly get drunk on a night out, compared to a fifth of the general population. It also revealed the risky effects of drinking, as young people admitted to forgetting how they got home, driving themselves home drunk or getting in a car with someone they knew was intoxicated. Genes that lie within DNA that is tightly wrapped around the histones are less active than if the DNA is loosely wrapped. The looser the DNA is coiled, the more accessible the genes are to the cellular machinery that 'expresses' them. The rats exposed to alcohol had more tightly coiled DNA. They also had increased levels of a protein called HDAC2, which modifies histones, causing DNA to be wound tighter around them. These epigenetic changes were linked to lowered expression of a gene that nerve cells need in order to form new connections between cells, known as synaptic connections. Professor Pandey argued the lowered activity of this gene may be due to the tighter winding of its DNA. The lower activity of the gene persisted in adulthood, even if alcohol exposure was stopped weeks before. The researchers also observed diminished connectivity between nerves in the amygdalae of these affected adult rats. But a cancer drug known to block the activity of HDAC2 could be used to treat them, he said. In his experiments, the drug restored expression of the gene needed for synapse formation and the rats' DNA was observed to be less tightly coiled. The effect of this was that the rats exhibited less anxiety and reduced alcohol intake. Professor Pandey added: 'We aren't sure if the drug needs to be given long term during adulthood in order to completely reverse the harmful effects of adolescent alcohol exposure.' The findings were reported online in the journal Neurobiology of Disease.\",\n",

Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity . The Government had said that everyone over the age of 55 who wanted to take part in the new pension freedoms would be given a free half-hour session of guidance but just 300 advisers are available (file picture) But one major provider reported that customers in their 20s had been calling up to withdraw their retirement savings – unaware they were three decades too young. Others were unaware they faced a hefty tax bill if they removed all their cash at once. The confusion was not helped by a decision to pull the plug on television adverts promoting the Government's pensions helpline. The Treasury said that, ahead of the election, it had switched to a 'low level' advertising campaign for its Pension Wise guidance service and dropped its television adverts for almost two months. 'Purdah' rules bar Government advertising campaigns before a general election so that it does not promote the cause of a certain political party.

The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its 'blood red' appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. Simon Allen, BOM's senior meteorologist, told the ABC that Adelaide would have the clearest skies out of all the states - where the partial eclipse began at 8.45pm and the peak at 10:30pm. In Brisbane, cloudy conditions and showers were forecast, denting the chances of seeing the eclipse.

Now the European\\xa0Commission, the EU's top antitrust authority,\\xa0is asking companies who previously filed confidential complaints against Google for permission to publish them, so that officials can begin to build a case against the firm. If found to have been behaving unfairly, Google could be fined ten per cent of its annual revenues, which would be more than £4 billion based on last year's performance. Facing huge fine:\\xa0Google is facing a fine of up to £4billion as Europe prepares to file a high-profile anti-competition lawsuit against the internet giant . Shopping, comparison and travel companies are among those that have been contacted by the EU, The Wall Street Journal reports. US companies Microsoft and Trip Advisor are among those that have filed complaints against Google with the EU. A decision to file charges would kick start the EU's most prominent antitrust suit since its ten year-long campaign against Microsoft Corp. - the firm was forced to pay out more than a £1billion in fines in 2012. The specific document the EU is said to be preparing is referred to as a Statement of Objections. Once filed, it's likely that a number of deeper investigations, counter-statements, and settlement discussions would ensue. If the search engine and the EU cannot come to an agreement, then fines could be issued and restrictions placed on Google's behavior. Leading investigation: New EU antitrust chief\\xa0Margrethe Vestager has suggested she favours pursuing legal action against Google over pushing for a settlement . The company would then have the right to appeal the case to the highest European court. Even if it is settled without a huge fine, antitrust cases can be hugely disruptive for firm, as Microsoft discovered. The European Commission has also been investigating whether Google has been 'scraping' content from rivals' sites, and placing unreasonable restrictions on advertisers and software developers who do business with them. A 'preliminary view' taken by the commission in March  2013 was that Google was abusing its dominant position in a number of areas . The company has denied any wrongdoing. Speaking in Berlin last week, Kent Walker, the company's Senior Vice President & General Counsel, highlighted the 'painfully long list of unsuccessful Google products', including Google+ and Street View in Germany, as proof that competition laws were serving their purpose. Long-running dispute: Former EU antitrust chief\\xa0Joaquin Almunia, above, made three unsuccessful attempts to resolve the dispute between Google and its European rivals . The EU's investigation of complaints that Google abuses its dominance of the online search market to hurt rivals began in 2010. The US company handles more than 90 per cent of Web searches in Europe - considerably higher than its share of the US market. Comparison-shopping sites claim that when consumers use Google to search for products online, Google positions results from Google Shopping prominently. The argument is that this\\xa0relegates products from rival sites to positions lower down the search page, where they might not be seen. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's new antitrust chief, has  suggested she will pursue legal action rather than seek a settlement. Google and Commissioner Vestager’s predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, made three attempts to resolve the dispute, but in each case intense pressure by national governments, Internet rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort. The latest settlement proposed by Mr. Almunia fell apart following a series of interventions by powerful political players, including a letter from the economy ministers of France and Germany calling for greater concessions from Google, and protests from German publishing houses. In November the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for a possible breakup of Google, brushing aside an unusual series of objections from the US Congress that the move risked politicizing an antitrust investigation. Ms. Vestager met a month ago with Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman. Last week, she indicated that her priority was to ensure that smaller Internet firms could compete with the industry's giants.\",\n",

Raymond Frolander, 18, was beaten to a pulp by the furious father after he walked in on the teenager performing a sexual act on his son at his home in\\xa0Daytona Beach, Florida, last July. After Frolander's arrest, police released his mugshot, which saw him sporting swollen lips and eyes, black bruises and lacerations to his face. The photo was quickly shared thousands of times online. Now, the defendant has been sentenced to a quarter of a century in prison by Circuit Judge Leah Case after pleading no contest to lewd and lascivious molestation of a victim younger than 12. Scroll down for 911 tape . Jailed: Raymond Frolander, 18, who was beaten unconscious by a furious father after sexually abusing his 11-year-old son, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. Above, the convict is pictured in court on Thursday . Bloodied: After Frolander's arrest, police released his mugshot, which saw him sporting swollen lips and eyes, black bruises and lacerations to his face. The photo (above) was quickly shared thousands of times online . Wearing an orange jail jumpsuit, Frolander showed little emotion as he agreed to a plea deal in a bid to avoid a mandatory life sentence on Thursday,  the Daytona Beach News-Journal\\xa0reported. Speaking outside court, the child's 35-year-old father - who is not being named to protect the identity of the victim - said the sentence would give his son's attacker the chance to reflect on his actions. 'He’s going to learn in the next 25 years why I let him live,' he told reporters, according to\\xa0WFTV. The youngster's grandmother added that the plea deal means her grandson will not have to go through the psychological trauma of a trial, saying: 'He just needs to learn to trust again.' As part of the deal, Frolander, who had been molesting the boy for years, will be listed as a sexual predator, be on sex offender probation and undergo electronic monitoring for life after his release. On the night of the attack, the child was apparently playing video games with Frolander and some friends. However, after the others left, the defendant took him to a back room, the boy told police. Father: Speaking outside court, the child's 35-year-old father (pictured)- who is not being named to protect the identity of the victim - said the sentence would give his son's attacker the chance to reflect on his actions . Plea deal: Frolander (pictured alongside his attorney on Thursday) showed little emotion as he agreed to a plea deal in a bid to avoid a mandatory life sentence lewd and lascivious molestation of a victim younger than 12 . Locked up: The youngster's grandmother said the plea deal means her grandson will not have to go through the psychological trauma of a trial. Above, Frolander is pictured being led away from the courtroom Thursday . There, Frolander reportedly pulled down the child's pants and performed a sex act on him, before being caught by the boy's father, who had just returned home after picking up some food. The father, who had heard a strange noise coming from the bedroom, pushed open the door and discovered Frolander with his genitals exposed, police said. He immediately started beating him. In the early hours of July 18, \\xa0the father called 911 and told the dispatcher:\\xa0'I just walked in on a grown man molesting [name redacted]. And I got him in a bloody puddle for you right now, officer.' He continued: 'He is nice and knocked out on the floor for you, I dragged him into the living room,' before adding: 'Send an ambulance. He is going to need one.' Police arrived at the house to find Frolander unconscious. During an interview, the boy told officers the suspect had been molesting him for three years - something Frolander later admitted to. Sex offender: As part of the deal, Frolander (pictured), who had been molesting the boy for years, will be listed as a sexual predator, be on sex offender probation and undergo electronic monitoring for life after his release . Bruised: The defendant is pictured during his first court appearance, still sporting injuries from the beating . After his arrest, Frolander was was treated at hospital before being taken to the closest police station. In his mug shot, his still-swollen face was evident from the beating he had received. Officers appeared to understand the father's reaction. 'Dad was acting like a dad. I don't see anything we should charge the dad with,' Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood said. Speaking to\\xa0WFTS, he added: 'You have an 18-year-old who has clearly picked his target, groomed his target and had sex with the victim multiple times.' Days after the incident, the father admitted that it was only his son's pleas which had stopped him from killing the pervert after he had stormed into the kitchen and grabbed a knife in his rage. 'My son is the one who stepped in front of me and stopped me. My son saved his attackers life, so who's really the hero in this situation?' he asked WKMG after Frolander's first court appearance in Volusia County. The man admitted he had 'just snapped' when he walked in on Frolander naked with his son. Shortly after beating the teenager into a coma, he  grabbed the knife and walked over to him, he said. 'I was going to kill him,' he admitted, adding that he and his family had considered Frolander a close friend and had often allowed him to spend time with the 11-year-old boy at their home. 'There was nothing uncommon to let the kids go in the bedroom and play video games together and now I have to wonder why the door was shut,' the father explained last July. Sexual assault: Officers appeared to understand the father's reaction. 'Dad was acting like a dad. I don't see anything we should charge the dad with,' Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood said. Above, the father is pictured with his 11-year-old son (left) before the attack, and Frolander is seen in a previous mug shot (right) He added that his rage also stemmed from being molested himself as a child at a foster home in California. He said beating Frolander was the easy part and that much harder days lay ahead. 'I'm not going to pressure anything on [my son],' the father told reporters. 'I know exactly what he's going through, when he's ready to talk about it, he will.' Police defended his actions but later criticized him for creating a Gofundme page, initially entitled 'Rebuilding Innocence' and featuring an image of a sleeping boy, asking for $1million in donations. On the page, the father wrote: 'We are reaching out to anyone that can help. Our son was sexualy (sic) assaulted and we are now faced with the challenge of picking up the pieces, the emotional and financial burden is about more than we can endure.. Please.. Anything helps.' Chf Chitwood told DailyMail.com he was 'pretty shocked' by the page, which was later taken down by the charity site. 'The police, investigators and prosecutors go to great lengths to protect victims of sexual abuse. I'm sure his intentions are in the right place but this is not good for the young man's recovery,' he said. During his interview with police, the child reportedly told officers that he had been intimidated and told by Frolander\\xa0that terrible things would happen to him if he revealed the abuse. 'He's 11 years old, he should be running around outside and playing video games, not dealing with something like this,' Chf Chitwood said at the time. No charges were filed against the boy's father.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Modern humans have been blamed for killing off the Neanderthals by out competing them, breeding with them and even outright murdering them. But new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of Africa that finished them off. Scientists studying the latest genetic, fossil and archaeological evidence claim that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today. Scroll down for video . Neanderthals, like the reconstruction above on display at the Natural History Museum in London, may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to Europe by modern humans as they migrated out of Africa . They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World. Another recent genetic study by scientists at the University at Buffalo has suggested that Neanderthals may have suffered from psoriasis and Crohn's disease, a condition that affects the digestive system. They speculate that pathogens like Heliocbacter pylori, the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers, were brought to Europe by modern humans from Africa and may have infected Neanderthals, who would have been unable to fight off these new diseases. However, Neandethals may have also helped modern humans by passing on slivers of immunity against some diseases to our ancestors when they interbred. Dr Simon Underdown, a principal lecturer in anthropology at Oxford Brookes University and co-author of the study, said: 'As Neanderthal populations became more isolated they developed very small gene pools and this would have impacted their ability to fight off disease. 'When Homo sapiens came out of Africa they brought diseases with them. 'We know that Neanderthals were actually much more advanced than they have been given credit for and we even interbred with them. 'Perhaps the only difference was that we were able to cope with these diseases but Neanderthals could not.' The findings add to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were not as different from modern humans as was originally thought. Recent discoveries have suggested that rather than being brutish cavemen, Neanderthals had sophisticated culture, were master tool makers and may even have had their own language. The new study suggests that Neanderthals also suffered from many of the same afflictions and complaints that modern humans experience. Indeed, there is some evidence from caves that early humans may have burned their bedding in a bid to rid themselves of infestations of lice or bed bugs. Dr Underdown and his colleague Dr Charlotte Houldcroft, a researcher in infectious diseases at Cambridge University and University College London, analysed recent genetic studies on Neanderthals and other early humans. They also examined recent genetic research on common human pathogens that have aimed to trace their origins and combined it with fossil and archaeological evidence. Infectious bacteria like those that cause tuberculosis, shown above, may have been common in Neanderthals . Most evidence from the fossil record suggest that Neanderthals tended to suffer traumatic injuries as a result of their hunter gatherer lifestyle, but there are also signs of inflammation and infection. Their study, which is published on the open source database bioRxiv, contradicts the common view that infectious diseases only really became a problem for humans in the Holocene about 11,000 years ago when humans began living in dense settlements and farming livestock. Instead, they say many of the diseases we see around us today were common during the pleistocene when Neanderthals dominated much of Europe and Asia between 250,000 and 45,000 years ago, when they disappeared. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies . They say pathogens like TB, typhoid and Crimean fever that were thought to be zoonoses caught from herd animals may have actually originated in humans and were only passed to animals during the rise of farming around 8,000 years ago. Genetic sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan - another early human ancestor - DNA has shown that modern humans have inherited a number of genes from these extinct species. These include genes that provide immunity to viral infections such as tick-borne encephalitis. Dr Underdown said this virus would probably have been common in the forested areas of northern Europe that Neanderthals inhabited and so immunity would have been an advantage. Other genes found in modern Papua New Guineans that are involved in the immune response against viruses like dengue and influenza may have come from Neanderthals. The fossilised remains of Neanderthals, like the skull above, are revealing more details about their lifestyles . Analysis of ancient DNA has also shown that Neanderthals carried genes that would have protected them against bacterial blood poisoning, or sepsis. Dr Underdown said: 'There are genetic signals in the Neanderthal genome that suggest quite clearly that they were exposed to these types of diseases but also developed some resistance to them. 'It had been thought that many of these diseases began infecting humans with the population increases that came with domestication of animals and permanent settlements. 'Be here we have got Neanderthals being infected by these diseases long before those developments.'\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Illicit operation: Chiropractor Gertrude Pitkanen would sell newborn babies to adoptive parents for as little as $100 in Butte, Montana . For as little as $100, chiropractor Gertrude Pitkanen took babies from their mother\\'s arms seconds after they were born and handed them to their adoptive parents. As the infants were driven to their new homes, the families were sometimes forced to throw their afterbirth out of the window because they were removed so quickly. These transactions formed the basis of a lucrative, illicit market that started in Butte, Montana, in 1920s, and grew until Pitkanen decided to stop in the 1950s. Most of the children who were victims of this horrific crime have now aged, have families and have forged their own lives - but they are still looking for answers. They have joined together to form a group called Gertie\\'s Babies who have been using DNA to trace their biological families and search for their estranged siblings that are still alive. Only a six of them have come together, but they believe there are many more people who were given up by Pitkanen out there, and simply do not know it. Heather Livergood, 69, was purchased for $100 in a motel room in 1946. \\xa0Now 69 she lives in Coeur d\\'Alene, northern Idaho, with her husband Steve. This May she will have been married for 47 years, has three children and is expecting a grandchild this month. Last year, while using sites such as Ancestory.com and 23andMe.com, she was able to track down two half brothers Bob and Gary, who live in Grantsville, Utah. Her birth mother was called Violet Weyland Sandberg, and discovered the circumstances which forced her to abandon her as a child. While her husband, Evan Sandberg a member of the Army Air Corps, had been fighting in the Pacific, she got pregnant with another man\\'s child, prompting her to take desperate action. She told the Daily Mail Online that her biological aunt, Julia, had told her children before she died that Violet had spent two months with a man in Montana while her husband was fighting. On a night in 1946, Violet\\xa0traveled\\xa0450 miles from Grantsville to give birth in Butte. That decision forged a certain\\xa0future for Mrs Livergood, . She moved into a good home with her adoptive family. Her mother died when she was three and she was raised by her father, a man who she said was \\'great, very funny and outgoing\\', and a stepmother. Heather Livergood (center), now 69, was given up for adoption in 1946 but has been reunited with brothers Gary (left) and Bob (right) following a trip to Grantsville, Utah, last year . However she has sympathy for her birth mother, because she had gotten herself into trouble. She told the\\xa0Spokesman-Review\\xa0in an interview last year: \\'I couldn\\'t give up a child, but I don\\'t blame her for that. And you know, things weren\\'t very good when the war got out. People didn\\'t have a lot of money.\\' Her adoptive father also shared a detail from the night she was born which prompted her to dig further into her family history. Mrs Livergood told the Daily Mail Online she visited her brothers last year after tracking them down and keeps in contact with them on a regular basis. She plans to return for another trip as she continues to build a relationship with them. Some others however have been\\xa0unsuccessful\\xa0in their search. Mrs Livergood discovered her birth mother was called\\xa0Violet Weyland Sandberg. She got pregnant with another man while her husband was away at war . Bonnie Gower told the Daily Mail Online that when she was born, she was given to parents who couldn\\'t have children through traditional methods. They had already adopted two boys and wanted a girl \\xa0but they were told they couldn\\'t have anymore. \\'A friend of theirs who had a adopted a son through Gertie got a call from the local go between asking them if they wanted a baby girl,\\' she told the Daily Mail Online. \\'They said no but called my mom and asked. My parents said yes and they drove to Butte to get me. My birth certificate is filled out in my Dad\\'s handwriting.\\' Her adoptive parents were told what to write and they handed over $500 to complete the\\xa0transaction. She added: \\'He [her father] said he couldn\\'t remember if they went the day I was born (probably not), but the date they were to write down was the day they got me. Throughout her childhood, Mrs Gower was always told she had been adopted and lived a good life. Her parents always said she was \\'special\\' because they picked her. \\'I did not know the black market baby stuff until I was ready to get married and decided I wanted to try to get my medical history, \\' she said. \\'In contacting the state they said there was no adoption papers and that I wasn\\'t adopted. Then I got the story from my parents. \\'My mom\\'s words were...\"we were never going to tell\". But they knew nothing of the birth mother and asked no questions. \\'I think they knew what they were doing was illegal, but they just wanted a baby and put that little fact away.\\' Mrs Gower has since completed the checks on Ancestory.com and has only found connections to third cousins. She has contacted them but is yet to receive a reply. \\'I suppose I will continue my search for many more years...but not aggressively as I did when we all connected,\\' she added. Sue Docken was also sold for $500 in 1951 from on office building in Butte. The transaction was expected to last just a few minutes, so her adoptive\\'s mother\\'s husband was told to leave the car running as he waited outside. She went back to the empty office building about a month ago to see where the exchange unfolded. Mable Deane, 65, who runs the Gertie\\'s Babies website, was given up in 1949, and is yet to learn much about her past. Pitkanen was never held accountable for the black market scheme which tore families apart. She was born in 1878 and trained as a nurse and chiropractor before moving with her husband Gustave Pitkanen to Butte. She died in 1960, but escaped criminal prosecution. It\\'s not known how much money she made from the scheme or how many of the adoptions she organised over at least three decades. According to The New York Times she worked with the political and business elite and had a \\'black book\\' with intelligence she could use as blackmail. She was charged with botched abortions on multiple occasions, but each time a judge threw out the case, fearing the repercussions of what she might do. Pitkanen also made her service available to prostitutes, an industry that was thriving in Butte at the time of her operation. Others who got pregnant out of wedlock or through affairs also used the service.',\n",

'A great haircut is key to going grey so you don't end up looking like you have given up on yourself!' Sibi also advises using a silver shampoo. 'It helps brighten the hair and remove yellow unflattering tones that grey hair has a tendency to do.

Some 3,000 French forces are taking part in the mission to stabilize Mali, which was overrun by Al Qaeda -linked extremists until French troops came to the aid of Malian soldiers in January 2013. Rijke was abducted by extremists in November 2011 from a hostel in Timbuktu along with two other people . A German died in the attack.

Despite her hefty frame, Ms Rachdi says she has always eaten healthily - and puts the excess pounds to eating more healthy food than she should. She also says she used food to control feelings of anxiety and to deal with her fear of failure but says all the comfort eating just made things worse in the end. 'My relationship with food is unhealthy,' she explains. 'I spend a lot of the day stressing about what I'm going to eat and when I'm going to get it. Comfort eating: Ms Rachdi, pictured with parents Patty and Abe, said she used food to deal with anxiety . Deadly: Ms Rachdi had become so heavy, she was warned that she risked dying by the age of 30 . 'There's anticipation before I eat but it's not enjoyable. It's a feeling of desperation and sadness. Food is a comfort and it's helping me avoid reality. I have a lot of anxiety and I don't like it. 'I'm at peace while I eat. I don't have to think about how I have let everyone around me down. It's a distraction.' As a result of her overeating, her parents were left in a state of panic, with mother Patty admitting that she was sure her daughter would die. 'She always felt she didn't live up to our expectations,' she says. 'She just became a typical underachiever. 'We were told that if she doesn't lose weight, she will die before she's 30.' 'I see a lot of pity in my mum's face when she looks at me and I can't handle that,' said Ms Rachdi, ahead of her surgery. Support: Ms Rachdi has been supported throughout by her boyfriend Rowdy who also moved to Houston . Getting there: Ms Rachdi had to lose 17lb before being allowed to have weight loss surgery . Slimmer: Ms Rachdi has now shed 20st and tips the scales at 26st - half her former body weight . 'Sometimes my dad would make snide comments about my size and that would hurt me. I wish I could be self-sufficient and successful and show the world I'm made of so much more but as long as I'm big, as long as I'm obese, I will never be able to be that person.' The turning point came when the Rachdi family relocated to Houston in Texas to be closer to bariatric specialist, Dr\\xa0Younan Nowzaradan. Last autumn, Ms Rachdi finally went under the knife for life-saving gastric surgery and has since lost a staggering 20st. But with another 9st to go, there is still a long way to go before Ms Rachdi becomes the 'successful, independent woman' she wants to be. Even so, things are finally looking up. 'I'm now able to shop for myself,' beams the 24-year-old who has also learned to drive. 'I have hope. Now the world is open to me. I'm no longer Amber of one room, one house. I'm no longer using food to cope with my anxiety.'\",\n",

Be it denim, cropped, printed or striped, the wide leg trouser is at the forefront of SS15 trends. There's something effortless about a wide leg trouser that really appeals. And if like us you are growing tired of the skinny jean and want to try out a new look this could be your answer. Louise Redknapp says that a wide-leg trouser can come as a welcome relief from the skinny jean . Skinny jeans have held court for quite a few years now and while they will never go out of style the wide leg will give you an alternative look. It's not the first time this look has made a comeback since the Seventies. Lou tried the out the trend seven years ago with a Stella McCartney flared jean - luckily she kept hold of them! The wide leg can be intimidating, especially if you're on the shorter side. But the key is all in the shoe. Huge amounts of fabric is hard to look flattering but if you keep your heels high and your top half simple you can pull it off with confidence. A high heeled shoe with an exposed top of foot will elongate the leg, a must when wearing a cropped voluminous trouser. Louise and Emma say to avoid being drowned by too much fabric try a high heeled shoe . Louise recommends pairing a wide-leg with a simple knit to keep the outfit in proportion . If going for a longer length go high-waisted and very long to give extra leg length. Proportion is everything, team with a simple knit, shirt or tee to keep the look current and cool, not costume. Denim is the easiest way to nail the trend - Gucci revisited the Seventies with a collection filled with flared jeans in vintage washes. The stylish pair agree that denim is the easiest way to achieve the trend . The wide-leg trouser made an appearance on several catwalks including on the runway of Gucci SS15 who showcased a denim take on the trend, for a high street take try the Topshop Miller jean (right) Celine showcased colourful billowing bottoms on their SS15 runway . Topshop meanwhile have been quick to follow suit with their version - the Miller - a 1970s-style wide leg flare. Celine and Stella McCartney kept it classy with a dressier-style pant, perfect for an evening look. Try new online label Finery London for a similar style with a lower price tag.

News that\\xa0Kim Jong-un is re-establishing the so-called 'pleasure troupe' was reported by South Korea's Chosun Ilbo. The tradition was established by the dictator's grandfather Kim Il-sung - who is considered the founder of North Korea and still holds the title of Eternal President despite dying in 1994. North Korean officials have traditionally scoured the countryside for pretty teenagers, sometimes as young as 13-years-old, who are then taken to Pyongyang to work as dancers, singers or servants for the country's leaders. Often the most attractive girls are forcibly married off to powerful military generals as a way of rewarding the men for their all-important loyalty to the regime. As part of the handover of power following the death of\\xa0Kim Il-sung in 2011, the entire troop was dismantled and sent off to marry members of the North Korean establishment.

The girls reportedly lived in the senior officials' houses and were traditionally allowed to marry their employers and 'retire' from service by the time they reached their early 20s. The three-year absence of the 'pleasure troupe' was due to a complete overhaul of the North Korean establishment by Kim Jong-un following his father's death. The dictator moved swiftly to remove the most powerful figures from his father's regime - having many of them executed - and replaced them with his own group of spineless bureaucrats.\",\n",

The Church of England’s ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of Bath’s 45°C spring water to power a modern heating system for the building. Bath Abbey (pictured) could have the world's first natural underfloor heating system sourced from spring water in Roman drains.\\xa0The idea has been in the pipeline for years, but now excavation work has begun to determine whether it’s possible to connect a modern heating system with an ancient hot spring . The Abbey, which lies at the heart of Britain's only World Heritage city, was granted planning permission for the unique £18million scheme two years ago. Engineers plan to excavate ancient crypts below the church to tap into a Roman drain where 850,000 litres of natural spring water empties every day into the ground. They hope to divert the warm water instead through a network of underground pipes to provide a world-first natural underfloor heating system for the abbey. Church leaders believe the plans would provide a unique source of green energy for the abbey and help the 10th century building reconnect with the city's Roman roots. Plans show how Bath Abbey will use water from the city's ancient springs, which heat water used in its Roan Baths. Waste water currently filters out to the River Avon but could be put to use under the new scheme . An artist's impression of plans for Bath Abbey shows how the ground will be excavated to create the heating system, new work space and song school . Today, excavation work is taking place on Kingston Parade outside the Visitor’s Information Centre to determine the feasibility of installing the system. Each day, a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the Roman Baths from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site. A large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby River Avon – passing through the Great Roman Drain. The idea is, that it this waste water was harnessed correctly and converted, it could produce 1.5 megawatts of continuous energy – enough to heat Bath Abbey and the world-famous Roman Baths and Pump Room complex. Engineers are currently digging 13 ft (4 metres) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could be suitable to house a thermal heat exchanger, which transfers heat from one medium to another. A spokesman for the project told MailOnline that the investigations are in their infancy, but it appears that water levels may be too low to use in the Great Roman Drain area, but that energy could be harnessed in the Georgian part of the drain. A small scale trial is also underway to test how the heat can warm up different types of stone floors in the buildings. The Church of England’s ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of Bath’s 45°C spring water to power a modern heating system for the building. The idea is that waste water from the baths escaping down the Great Roman Drain would enter a hidden thermal heat exchange and heat the Abbey (illustrated above) Engineers plan to tap the power of warm waste water from the Roman bathing complex (pictured).\\xa0Engineers are currently digging 13 ft (4 metres) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could be suitable to house a thermal heat exchanger . The plans for Bath Abbey's underfloor heating may use modern technologies, but will make use of the same natural spring tapped by the Romans. The Romans came up with underfloor heating called a hypocaust, which heated houses and public spaces with hot air. The word comes from the Ancient Greek, where hypo means under and caust means burnt. Romans used underfloor heating, or hypocausts to heat rooms at Bath's intricate bathing complex. Here, you can see the pilae stacks though which hot air would have circulated to heat a tile floor on top . The floor was raised above the ground by pillars called pilae stacks and made of a layers of tiles sandwiched together with concrete. The air under the floor was heated by a furnace. Walls were also made of hollow bricks so hot air could circulate through them, as well as below the tiles. Rooms requiring the most heat were placed closest to the furnace, the heat of which could be adjusted by adding more wood to the fire. It was labour intensive to sun a hypocaust as the fire needed a lot of fuel and constant attention, meaning underfloor heating was used in large public buildings, luxurious villas and bath complexes. Every day, a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the Roman Baths from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site. A large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby River Avon (pictured)– passing through the Great Roman Drain . The modern elements of the system would be hidden underground and an archaeologist will be working alongside the engineers to document any objects that may be uncovered by the excavation. Once the investigation is complete, the ground will be covered back up and the engineers will work out how the thermal heat exchanger will be housed. Charles Curnock, Footprint Project Director from Bath Abbey, said: ‘An innovative thermal heating scheme using Bath’s hot springs ticks all the right boxes, while providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for both the Abbey and the Roman Baths & Pump Room complex.’ Two years ago, Bath Abbey rector Edward Mason said: ‘These are ambitious plans which would allow us to capture an incredible and ancient natural resource which is currently being wasted. ‘The Abbey lies at the heart of what was once Roman Bath, and our architects have located a drain where spring water flows. ‘As it stands, the water pours away and empties eventually into the Avon. ‘Our plan is to remove the floor of the Abbey, dig down and divert the drain and then pump the water through an underground heating system to warm the church. ‘It would provide virtually all of the Abbey's heating and would give us a unique way to reduce our carbon footprint.'

A policeman convicted of misconduct in a public office after having sex with women he met on duty was today labelled ‘a disgrace’ to the force. Adam Rushton took advantage of being a beat officer in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, to have sex with women, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The 37-year-old officer was found guilty of five counts of misconduct and another of breaching data protection rules by obtaining personal data. Rushton, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, denied ten counts of misconduct and two of breaching data protection laws while employed by police. He was acquitted on the remaining counts. Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker called Rushton ‘a disgrace to the police service’ who had ‘brought shame on himself, his colleagues’ and the force. Giving evidence, Rushton, who has been with the force for ten years, conceded some of his actions were ‘not very professional’ but claimed it did not amount to criminal misbehaviour. During the trial, he said he never expected to end up in the dock after going to one woman's home and having oral sex. ‘It's not very professional, I fully accept that, and that it's wrong,’ Rushton told jurors. ‘But no way whatsoever did I think I'd be standing here.’ He was convicted over that offence, and of making a social visit to another victim, while on the clock. Rushton was also convicted of having sex with a different woman at her house. He was found guilty on two counts relating to another woman, whom he met outside work, on one occasion having sex with her while on another exchanging ‘playful and flirty’ text messages before going to her home. Beat officer: Rushton has been with Staffordshire Police (whose headquarters are pictured) for ten years . His conviction for breaching data rules was in relation to looking up information relating to a fifth victim. The offences all happened between 2008 and 2012. When first interviewed over the allegations in April 2013, he denied sleeping with all but one of the women, however later accepted he had sex with several others. However, he denied his actions were criminal misconduct. Rushton had an impressive professional record as a neighbourhood policing officer, with many letters of praise from senior officers. But Crown Prosecutor Duncan Bould said the constable's duties brought him into contact with ‘vulnerable and frightened females, often in extreme circumstances’ and he had ‘sought to take advantage of those situations to have sexual activity of some kind with them’. Criticism:\\xa0Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker (pictured) called Rushton ‘a disgrace to the police service’ after the verdicts . None of the women made any complaints to police about Rushton. He was conditionally bailed after the verdicts were read out and will be sentenced at the crown court on May 1. After the hearing, Mr Baker apologised to the police officer's victims on behalf of the force. He said: ‘This was an astonishing breach of trust by an individual officer and he has badly let down vulnerable victims and their families. The public must be able to trust their police officers, and on this occasion they have been let down. ‘We made the decision that Rushton should be prosecuted as a police officer, and hope this sends out a very strong message - no matter who you are, and what position you hold, if you commit crime you will be dealt with firmly and robustly.’ He added that after the allegations came to light in 2013, the matter was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which carried out an investigation. Mr Baker said that, as a result, ‘robust processes’ were now in place to prevent such incidents happening. IPCC commissioner Kathryn Stone said Rushton had abused a position of trust and used his job ‘in a calculated manner to satisfy his own sexual desires’. Ms Stone added: ‘The IPCC has previously expressed concern at the number of cases across England and Wales where officers have targeted vulnerable women for sex. 'And I hope that today's outcome reinforces a message that corrupt officers will be discovered and brought before the courts where appropriate.’\",\n",

Ms Ainscough, 30, died in late February following a lengthy fight with a rare and aggressive form of cancer known as\\xa0epithelioid sarcoma. She spurned chemotherapy and radiation, choosing to fight the cancer with a controversial treatment known as Gerson Therapy, which involves a vegan diet and coffee enemas and does not have scientific support. But after discussions with 'oncologists, healers and specialists around the world', in her final weeks - the most 'difficult' weeks of her fight - Ms Ainscough began a course of targeted radiation, her partner Tallon Pamenter has revealed. 'This was a risky and tough decision, but Jess bravely embraced this last chance option,' he said. Jessica Ainscough (left) was planning to marry her partner Tallon Pamenter this year. She died after a long fight with cancer in February . 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life,' Mr Pamenter said . Tribute: Jessica Ainscough died in late February after a seven-year-long battle with cancer . 'In true wellness warrior style, we integrated our natural healing regime with the recommended radiation. 'Finally the walls were broken down between conventional and unconventional medicine - I don't know why as a society we must choose one or the other. 'This was something Jess was looking forward with sharing (with her followers).\\xa0It was an exciting evolution from her earlier days of feeling that she had to be part of one extreme world or the other.' Mr Pamenter said the six weeks of her radiation were among the toughest the couple - who were planning to marry this year - had been through. 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included.' The radiation successfully managed to shrink the tumour but 'some complications arose during the final stages of treatment'. 'Not long after, the words I LOVE YOU would leave my lips only to fall softly upon Jess's ears for the last time. 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since.' 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included,' She 'showed (her partner Tallon) what it means to live in a world full of love', he said in his tribute . 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since' 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life. 'I have been taken to a place so foreign and unknown with no navigational bearing on how to get back. 'Loved ones tell me to be strong during this time... but the thing is I don't want to be strong... I want to cry when I'm sad, yell when I'm angry and smile during those fleeting moments of happiness brought on by the memories we created together. 'I want to sit in silence and be present with every single emotion that decides to show up. 'It's in those moments I feel closest to her.' Ms Ainscough made the decision to undergo radiation after the fungating tumour in her left shoulder became large and painful. It began to interfere with her 'ability to enjoy her favourite things like walking our furbabies on the beach', Mr Parmenter said. Mr Pamenter told Daily Mail Australia she planned to tell her followers about her new treatment just days after she passed away. Ms Ainscough was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 when she was 22 and working at Dolly magazine, a favourite of teenage girls. She initially underwent targeted chemotherapy to her left arm, according to reports, but the cancer returned a year later. She also refused doctors' advice to have her left arm amputated. Jessica's mother was also diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and, inspired by her daughter's fight, she also adopted the Gerson Therapy method. The alternative treatment did not work, and her mother passed away in 2013, an event which Ms Ainscough said brought her to her knees. Mr Pamenter said his partner 'showed me what it means to live in a world full of love'. She was laid to rest in early March.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"For the first time in 65 years the California Department of Water Resources has found no snow during its manual survey of the land at 6,800 feet in the Sierra Nevada in early April. Governor Jerry Brown observed the survey on Wednesday, which found the lowest water level in the Sierra Nevada snowpack since 1950 when records began. The fourth consecutive year of vanishing snow spells trouble as California depends on it to melt into rivers and replenish reservoirs. As he stood in a brown meadow that's normally blanketed in snow, Gov. Brown ordered sweeping, unprecedented measures to save water in the state. Scroll down for video . What a difference a year makes: Spatial distribution of the total volume of water in the snowpack across the Tuolumne River Basin in California's Sierra Nevada mountains as measured by NASA's Airborne Snow Observatory is seen in images from March 25, 2015 (bottom) and April 7, 2014 (top) 'We're in a new era; the idea of your nice little green grass getting water every day, that's going to be a thing of the past,' Brown said. The governor's order requires cities and towns to cut water use by 25 percent. So far in the current drought, many Californians have not made changes to their daily routines to save water or taken a hit in their wallets because of it. Attending the survey with Gov Brown was DWR Director Mark Cowin, who said Californians can expect to receive almost no water from the meager snowpack as it melts in the coming weeks. 'Today's survey underscores the severity of California's drought,' he said. 'Water conservation must become a way of life during the worst drought in most Californians' lifetimes.' In what were considered normal precipitation years, the snowpack supplied about 30 percent of California's water needs as it melts in the spring and summer. California's historically wettest winter months have already passed, and the drought is now firmly rooted in its fourth consecutive year, reports AGWeb. Frank Gehrke, left, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program for the Department of Water Resources, and Gov. Jerry Brown walk across a dry meadow that is usually covered in several inches of snow as conducts the snow survey, near Echo Summit on Wednesday . One year ago: In this April 1, 2014 photo, Frank Gehrke, chief of snow surveys for California's Department of Water Resources, crosses a meadow still covered in snow as he returns from conducting the snowpack survey at Echo Summit, California . Early last year, Brown called for a 20 percent voluntary cutback, but the state achieved just half of that. In recent years, cities have developed storage capacity and supplies to soften the blow of future dry years — a move that has insulated residents from the severity of the current drought. In 1977, Brown asked for a voluntary 25 percent cut in water use during his first term as governor. Nearly 40 years later, he warns that drought might be the new normal as he ramps up efforts to adapt. His executive order on Wednesday directed officials to impose statewide mandatory water restrictions and expand programs intended to reshape how Californians use water. Cemeteries, golf courses and business headquarters must significantly cut back on watering the large landscapes. Local governments will tear out 50 million square feet of lawns and instead use drought-tolerant plants.\\xa0And customers will get money for replacing old water-sucking appliances with efficient ones under a temporary rebate program. This 3-D composite image map of the Sierra snowpack released by NASA shows the deficit in the total volume of water contained within the Tuolumne River Basin snowpack from April 7, 2014 to March 25, 2015 . The initiatives are part of the goal to reduce water use by 25 percent compared to levels in 2013 — the year before Brown declared a drought emergency. The order also directs local agencies to charge extra for high water use. Water officials vowed to crack down on waste and illegal water diversion, acknowledging there has been spotty enforcement of existing rules limiting outdoor water use. The order also prohibits new homes and developments from using drinkable water for irrigation if the structures lack water-efficient drip systems. In addition, the watering of decorative grasses on public street medians is banned. 'We have to pull together and save water in every way we can,' Brown said. Critics of the Democratic governor said his order does not go far enough to address agriculture — the biggest water user in California. The Enterprise Bridge passes over full water levels at a section of Lake Oroville on July 20, 2011 (top) in Oroville, California, compared with August 19, 2014 (bottom) The order contains no water reduction target for farmers. Instead, it requires many agricultural water suppliers to submit detailed drought management plans that include how much water they have and what they're doing to scale back. After a drought in the previous decade, state officials acknowledged that some suppliers did not submit similar required plans. Mark Cowin, director of the Department of Water Resources, said the state will provide money to make sure the plans are written and might penalize those who do not comply. The state is not aiming to go after water-guzzling crops such as almonds and rice the same way Brown has condemned lawns. Dave Kranz, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation, said farmers have already suffered deep cutbacks in water supply during the current drought. Farmers have let hundreds of thousands of acres go fallow and laid off thousands of workers as the state and federal government slashed water deliveries from reservoirs. Officials said Wednesday the statewide snowpack is equivalent to 5 percent of the historical average for April 1 and the lowest for that date since the state began record-keeping in 1950. 'It is such an unprecedented lack of snow, it is way, way below records,' said Frank Gehrke, chief of snow surveys for the California Department of Water Resources. Cemeteries, golf courses and business headquarters must significantly cut back on watering the large landscapes .\",\n",

But now, thanks to Amanda Holden, the RSPCA and, just possibly, you, many of these long-suffering animals could be given happy new homes. The Britain’s Got Talent judge is presenting a new series on ITV which will highlight the plight of the animals arriving at the RSPCA’s Newbrook Farm Animal Centre in Birmingham. Animal lover: Amanda Holden will host the new show on ITV highlighting plight of RSPCA centre in Birmingham . On Give A Pet A Home, Amanda and her co-stars – including Loose Women’s Coleen Nolan, Olympic gold medallist Denise Lewis and former Pussycat Dolls singer Kimberly Wyatt – will appeal to members of the public to take in the animals featured. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Amanda said: ‘As Brits, we are the land of the underdog and the land of pets. I think we really appreciate the loyalty and love animals give back. ‘It’s only a small minority of people who mistreat animals, whereas the majority will watch the show and think they can give something back by giving a pet a home. Perry, the black and white cat, is six, like curling up in a lap and being groomed but dislikes too much noise. Darcy, the female degu, likes playing with jingly balls and chewy toys but doesn't like being on her own . Homeless: Rocky, a greyhound, one, has only been at the centre for a month. He can be a little shy but likes living with other dogs . It’s not just cats and dogs – it’s horses, ferrets, rabbits, guinea pigs, birds, anything, really and you’ll see how the RSPCA operates from the ground up. ‘I hope that every week we’ll find lots of homes for otherwise unwanted animals.’ Amanda has a Yorkshire terrier/Jack Russell cross called Rudie, and a Siberian fluffball cat, Muffy, and admits she loves her pets and gives them the full run of the house. She said: ‘When I’m on the loo, I have the children, the cat and the dog in with me chatting away.’ Given the boot: Fern is a two-year-old black gerbil \\xa0who likes lots of handling, playing with toys and her tunnels. She has been at the centre since last July . Her aim for the show is to inspire families to share her love of furry animals and to adopt one as a pet. Viewers interested in adopting a pet can apply on the ITV.com website after each show. Applications will be sifted and those offering the best matches will be vetted by the RSPCA. Successful applicants will be featured on the following week's show. She said: ‘Although there will be some tear-jerking stories along the way, we’re also going to have a lot of fun watching the celebrities get stuck in. We want to unite as many pets as we can with new owners.’ Amanda has two daughters Lexi, nine, and Hollie, three, with record producer husband Chris Hughes, and has shared her love of animals with her family. ‘The only downside of doing this job is that it’s going to be very hard for me not to take the animals home,’ she says. Loving: Petal is a ginger and white dwarf lop rabbit, aged one, that would be happy living in a house but is quite wriggly to handle. Buster, right, is a brindle and white Staffordshire bull terrier, eight, who loves his lower back tickling but is not so keen on other dogs . Companions: Ailsa and Anna are two female gerbils who need to be kept together. They are very sociable, good with children and enjoy being handled . The presenters have been trained as RSPCA volunteers and will take part in chores and witness emergency calls and rescues. The six-week ITV series begins on Wednesday, April 15 at 8pm.\",\n",

The concerns around Fiona Stanley Hospital, in southwest Perth, were revealed to theWest Australian\\xa0by unnamed sources. However, according to health authorities, the move was purely based on reshuffling junior medical faculty. The latest potential developments at the hospital follow recent reports  that blood and bone fragments were found on supposedly sanitised medical instruments. The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was found to have blood and bone fragments of some its medical instruments . The West Australian was told junior doctors were moved to 'maximise training opportunities' by a state committee that organises both accreditation and training for the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The hospital went on 'baby bypass' when the maternity unit opened four months ago, due to an unexpectedly high number of women giving birth.\\xa0The hospital consequently had to direct expectant mothers to other hospitals. This week the RANZCOG told the West Australian that the obstetrics unit, which opened on December 2 last year,\\xa0was approved for  training in March. Michael Gannon, president of the Australian Medical Association WA, told the West Australian he knew of issues surrounding the recently opened obstetrics unit. He said concerns of the unit's services were similar to others at the hospital, due to planning issues from years ago. The hospital was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February . Earlier in the week, it was revealed that the hospital's medical service provider Serco failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February. The company was fined $60,000 and was subject to Department of Health workers auditing its staff, but the hospital was reportedly operating with poorly sanitised instruments, reported the ABC. Australian Medical Association WA president Michael Gannon noted recent reports that some instruments contained blood and human matter. 'There's been reports of bits of bone on some orthopaedic equipment, there's been reports, that are really hard to believe, of blood still being seen on some instruments,' he said. 'So this gives us great concern.'. Dr Gannon said the latest revelations will further damage the hospital's public image and likely cause a loss of morale within its workforce. 'I can't imagine how people must feel if they've got surgery booked at the hospital at some stage,' he said.\",\n",

Fund manager Nicola Horlick, 54, said she felt a noticeable difference in her body between her first child at age 25 and her last at 38. She revealed juggling child-rearing with boardroom duties meant she had to breastfeed in the office – even while carrying out job interviews. Nicola Horlick, 54, whoraised six children while working in the City, says women should have babies early . Her eldest daughter Georgina died from leukaemia in 1998 age 12. Mrs Horlick has children Alice, 26, Serena, 24, Rupert, 21, Antonia, 18, and Benjie, 15. She said: ‘I had my last child when I was 38 and I was 25 when I had Georgie and I noticed a major difference between the first and the last in terms of my body. ‘My advice to them [her daughters] is not to leave it too late to get married and to have children in their twenties if possible. It is better for you and better for the baby. ‘When I breastfed it was in the office and I have breastfed when I have been interviewing people for jobs. ‘I used to have a shawl and I would put it over the head of a baby and no one cared. But if you do it with your breast bare in public then it does affect some people and maybe older people. ‘I don’t think there is any point in doing that and babies don’t mind having a shawl over their head.’ She is disapproving of stay-at-home mothers because she believes the lifestyle will leave them twiddling their thumbs. ‘I don’t think women should be stay at home mums because if you are an ambitious and intelligent woman what are you going to do sitting at home whilst your child is at school?’ she said. A family photo shows Nicol Horlick, pictured with her children Georgina at 10, Alice at eight, Serena at six, Rupert at three and Antonia, aged seven months, with Nanny Joan Buckfield . ‘But I don’t think it’s particularly acceptable for mothers to do jobs that involve them working later into the night and all weekend. If you are doing that then what is the point of having a baby?’ The fund manager, who is married to second husband financial journalist Martin Baker after divorcing Tim Horlick in 2005, said she does not feel her hard work has negatively impacted her children. ‘I don’t actually feel that my children have suffered and I don’t carry any guilt. People often ask me “Do you feel guilty?” and the answer is no. Because my children are better off having a mother who feels fulfilled than a mother who feels unfulfilled,’ she said. Mrs Horlick is now campaigning for Just A Drop, which aims to reduce child mortality by delivering clean and safe drinking water. She revealed her daughter Georgina inspired her to fundraise for Africa before she died. Mrs Horlick explained: ‘When she was having her bone marrow transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital it was during a time when there was one of those terrible famines in the Sudan. 'Georgie said the most incredible thing to me. She said: “Mummy why are they wasting money on my bone marrow transplant when I am probably going to die any way and they could be spending that money on food for those children. All they need is food and if they were given food they would live.” It was the most extraordinary thing to say and she was very insightful.’ ‘When Georgie died I knew that she would want me to try and do something about those children in Africa.’\",\n",

Mr Lubitz is the man who orchestrated the disaster by steering flight 9525, from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, into the mountains killing all of those on board. It has since emerged that Mr Lubitz had carefully planned the attack using the online pseudonym ‘Skydevil’, according to the German newspaper Bild. As the plane plummeted towards ground, Mr Sondheimer, 36, a father-of-two, tried in vain to save the lives of the 144 passengers and five crew members on board. Moments before, he had left the cockpit in the hands of his co-pilot in order to use the bathroom. When he returned, the door was locked and co-pilot Lubitz, 27, ignored desperate pleas from his colleague to let him back in. In a desperate attempt to stop the fatal crash, Mr Sondheimer spent up to five minutes attempting to smash his way into the cockpit using an axe. Mr Sondheimer used an axe to try to break down the door to the cockpit after Lubitz (right) locked him out before accelerating into a mountain .

On recordings retrieved from the plane’s black box Mr Sondheimer can be heard shouting: ‘Open the goddam door’ in the moments before his death. The display in memory of the staff who died was created before it was revealed that Mr Lubitz had intentionally crashed the plane in the French Alps on March 24. Alongside the two men, sit the photographs of the other four crew members killed during the tragedy. All four are seen smiling broadly at the camera. The picture was taken at Dusseldorf airport, according to German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. Last night, Mr Sondheimer’s heartbroken mother paid tribute to her ‘hero’ son at her home 15 miles from the German town of Dusseldorf. Mrs Sondheimer said: ‘He died a hero but he still died, and we are devastated. The light has gone out of our lives. I am too upset to say any more.’ Shortly before the crash, Mr Sondheimer, the father of a six-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy, had switched from long-haul to short-haul flights in order to spend more time with his young family. During a memorial on March 29, his grandmother Marianne Sondheimer said her grandson’s lifelong dream was to become a pilot. She said: ‘My grandson is dead and all because of an idiot who did this to his whole flight and killed so many people.’ During the service, Captain Sondheimer was described as a man who ‘radiated happiness’. Black box recordings revealed Mr Sondheimer frantically appealed to Lubitz to open the door as the plane plunged further towards a mountain. He was described as a hero by his family .',\n",

As the election gets underway the gloves have come off between the main parties, and for three frontbenchers the tops have come off as well. Tory health minister Dan Poulter, Lib Dem minister Tom Brake and Labour frontbencher Gavin Shuker imposed strict cuts on their calories and put themselves at the mercy of a personal trainer for Men's Health magazine. Scroll down for video . Health minister Dan Poulter saw his weight fell from 105kg to 102.5kg, losing two inches off his 35in waist. His body fat fell from 24 per cent to 18 per cent . Cooped up in the Department of Health, he admitted it is difficult to practice what he preaches on keeping healthy . Skipping breakfast, grabbing lunch on the go and late nights in Parliament's bars and restaurants can take its toll on MPs when they arrive in Westminster. After five years of the coalition government, the three MPs agreed to take part in the feature for the Men's Health magazine, which is better known for its front covers of rippling muscles and toned six packs. Each was given strict orders to eat more healthily, do more exercise and take better care of their bodies. There was the inevitable unflattering 'before' photo shoot, followed by a full-length portrait to show off their new physique. Mr Poulter, a GP first elected in 2010, could be expected to already know what it takes to stay healthy. But cooped up in the Department of Health, he admitted it is difficult to practice what he preaches. 'I have an erratic diary, working\\xa015-hour days, so it does require real dedication to get\\xa0gym sessions in', he said. His personal trainer Stephen White put him on a\\xa0regime of fat-burning intervals and muscle-building resistance training. He said: 'Dan really\\xa0struggled at first because of his back – we focused on loosening and developing it to pull his shoulders\\xa0back and correct his terrible posture.' In the end Mr Poulter's weight fell from 105kg to 102.5kg, losing two inches off his 35in waist. His body fat fell from 24 per cent to 18 per cent, and he boasted of feeling 'fitter, stronger, more awake and\\xa0motivated in my work'. Lib Dem deputy Commons leader Tom Brake was told to build his upper-body strength and after six weeks of training could swim the 750m of the sprint distance triathlon without reverting to breast stroke . As deputy leader of the Commons, Mr Brake's job involved a lot of sitting on the green leather benches listening to debates. The Lib Dem MP and keen marathon runner could have been forgiven for thinking he was fit. But after casting an eye over his 'before' physique, personal trainer Daniel Marshall declared: 'Tom neglected every muscle from the waist up.' The 52-year-old was told to build his upper-body strength and after six weeks of training could swim the 750m\\xa0of the sprint distance triathlon\\xa0without reverting to breast stroke. He lost only a kilo of his 83.5kg starting weight, but his chest size grew from 38in to 48 in, while he lost an inch from his waist. Mr Brake said: 'I used to think\\xa0going to the gym was a waste of time, and that you\\xa0were much better off going for a run. Not anymore.' Labour MP Gavin Shuker\\xa0embarked on an intense weight loss regime, forced to shun carbs and alcohol when being wined and dined in Westminster .

A shadow International Development minister, he says that he succumbed to the 'parliamentary\\xa0stone' - the extra 14 pounds new MPs put on in their first year after arriving in Westminster. In fact he went even further, and put on three stone within 12 months. Men's Health rather unkindly remarked: 'The fact that the shadow minister hadn’t done\\xa0any exercise since his school days compounded\\xa0the problem – the only internationally perceptible\\xa0development being around his waistline. 'The only internationally perceptible\\xa0development being around his waistline.' He embarked on an intense weight loss regime, forced to shun carbs and alcohol when being wined and dined in Westminster. 'I’m sure at one point an MP’s life was all big boozy\\xa0lunches and champagne dinner receptions,' he said. 'The reality now is that if you eat lunch at all, it’ll be out of a box at your desk, like most people.' Surprisingly, he was told to eat more, not less, but make it healthy. The 33-year-old had got into the habit of not eating during the day and gorging at night. For the first time in decades he started eating porridge for breakfast. In the end he managed to lose more than 10kg, taking him down to 85kg. His waist slimmed down from 44in to 37in, while his biceps expanded from 32cm to 35cm. The magazine suggested the spectacle of three MPs naked from the waist up could inspire its readers to get fit themselves. It said: 'If they can juggle work and fitness, you sure as hell can too.

Adam Crapser, 39, of Salem, was issued with deportation papers by the\\xa0Department of Homeland Security in January and a\\xa0hearing is set for April 2. The father-of-three, who has a fourth child on the way, arrived in America with the name Shin Sonh Hyuk in 1979 around the age of three along with his biological sister. However, his first set of adoptive parents abandoned him and the second set turned out to be abusive. Adding to Crapser's struggles, at no point did his guardians seek the green card or citizenship for him that they should have. Deportation fears: Korean adoptee Adam Crapser, left, poses with daughters, Christal, one, Christina, five, and his wife, Anh Nguyen, in the family's living room in Oregon . Now,  after a life battling joblessness because of his lack of immigration papers, homelessness and crime, Crapser is facing deportation. 'The state abandoned him when he was a child,' his attorney, Lori Walls, said. 'Now the US is throwing him out.' Federal immigration officials say they became aware of Crapser after he applied to renew his green card two years ago: his criminal convictions, ranging from burglary to assault, made him potentially deportable under immigration law. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement wasn't aware of Crapser's childhood adoption history when it decided to pursue his deportation, agency spokesman Andrew Munoz said. Two U.S. senators, including Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, are proposing a stand-alone, automatic citizenship bill for adoptees like Crapser. Growing pains: This undated photo provided by Crapser shows him around the age of three with his sister . Struggles:\\xa0Abandoned by one adoptive family, separated for nearly three decades from his only biological sister, and exposed to abuse by another American adoptive couple, Crapser struggled with rejection, homelessness and crime . 'It was not his responsibility to fill out that immigration paperwork,' Merkley said. 'He knows no other country.' Advocates say thousands of adoptees don't know they aren't citizens until they, for example, try to get a job. The federal government does not track the citizenship status of international adoptees or how many have faced deportation. The State Department says it is aware of adult adoptees who are in immigration removal proceedings. Adoptees who didn't become citizens are lawful permanent residents - but they lack the documents to prove it. Their stories about deportation to countries as diverse as India, Russia or Brazil are detailed on advocacy websites. Many of them remained stuck in legal limbo. A provision that would make citizenship automatic for all international adoptees regardless of age was added to a Senate immigration bill several years ago. But when reform stalled, the provision did, too. Since the 1950s, American couples have adopted nearly half a million children from other countries; about 100,000 of those children came from South Korea. For years, it was the parents' responsibility to seek citizenship, but many did not. In 2000, lawmakers made citizenship automatic for international adoptees, but the law wasn't retroactive. It excluded adoptees 18 or older at the time. Crapser wouldn't have met the criteria. Seven years after Crapser and his sister were adopted, their parents abandoned them. The foster care system separated Crapser, ten at the time, from his sister, whom he was dependent on, according to orphanage records. The boy bounced through several foster and group homes. When Crapser was 12, he moved in with Thomas and Dolly Crapser, their biological son, two other adoptees and several foster children. The next four years, Adam Crapser said, the couple choked, kicked and hit him and the other children every day, slammed them against walls, set dogs to attack them and burned them with hot objects. Still in limbo: Crapser  poses with daughter, Christal, one,  in the family's living room . 'Everything I did was wrong,' he said. 'As far as humiliation goes, I have been there.' His father also used racial epithets to address him and forced him to forget Korea. 'He always told me I'm American, and that I need to let go of my past,' Adam Crapser said. In 1991, the couple was arrested on charges of physical child abuse, sexual abuse and rape. They denied the charges. Thomas Crapser's sentence included 90 days in jail, and his wife's three years of probation. Because students at his high school teased him about the abuse, Adam Crapser said he dropped out of 9th grade. He became homeless and slept in a shelter or the back of an old car while working several fast food jobs and finishing his high school equivalency diploma at night. The Crapsers had not obtained U.S. citizenship papers for him. Over the next few years, Adam Crapser struggled alone, and also got into trouble with the law. Once it was after he broke into his parents' home - it was, he said, to retrieve the Korean Bible and rubber shoes that came with him from the orphanage - and later it was for stealing cars and assaulting a roommate. Because he lacked a green card to prove he could work in the U.S., he opened a barber shop and an upholstery business - something he could do without immigration papers. He said his parents withheld his adoption record for years, so it wasn't until 2012 that Adam Crapser submitted a green card application - which set in motion his path to a deportation hearing. Adam Crapser said he takes full responsibility for his crimes, but he has 'done his time' and changed his life. 'America promised me a home,' he wrote in his court declaration. 'I implore this country to keep its promise. If not for me then for my children, so they won't have to grow up without a dad.'\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'The new 4G mobile phone services in the UK are not as super-fast as the industry promised - and could get worse. The mobile phone companies boasted that 4G services would be ‘five times faster’ than the existing 3G networks when they launched in the autumn of 2012. However, a new official study puts the real figure at an average of 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second compared to 5.9Mbit/s per second on the 3G service that most people use. A study by Ofcom says 4G speeds in the UK are slower than promised. Mobile phone companies boasted 4G would be five times faster than 3G. But the actual figure is actually only 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second. Shown is an HTC One XL smartphone at a news conference in Zurich launching 4G in 2012 . At the same time, the evidence suggests that 4G services are likely to slow down as more people connect to them. 4G technology is being promoted by the big mobile networks on the basis it offers high speed internet access and smooth video streaming without annoying buffering. More than 10 million people have been won over by the promises and have signed two year contracts costing an average of £20 ($30) a month. The 4G speed data comes from the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, which supports the technology and insists the figures show a meaningful and significant benefit over the 3G services. Despite this, the figures make clear the step change has not been as remarkable as the major networks - EE, O2, Vodafone and Three - promised. Ofcom’s research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts EE, which is the subject of a £12.5 billion ($18.5 billion) takeover by BT, on top. EE’s 4G network, which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses, delivered the fastest average download speed of 18.6Mbit/s. This looks good when compared with its 3G service, which was a slow 4Mbit/s. Second fastest was Vodafone with 16.4 for 4G versus 6.6 for 3G. O2 came next at 13.9 versus 6.6, followed by Three at a relatively slow 8.5 for 4G which was not very impressive against the 5.4 for 3G. Upload speeds are important when sharing content, such as pictures and videos to social media sites like Instagram and Facebook. EE was also fastest on this measure at 17.6Mbit/s, followed by O2 on 13.2, Vodafone on 13.1 and Three with 9.4. The Three network was the fastest to load a web page at 0.63 seconds, compared to 0.71 for O2, 0.76 for Vodafone and 0.77 for EE. There is good evidence to believe the speeds offered by 4G are slowing down. When 4G services launched at the end of 2012, the average download speed was up at around 19 Mbit/s, however the new research suggests an average of 14.7 and other studies put it as low as 10. This has happened because more people are using the service, effectively causing jams on the airwaves. The only way this can be countered is if the networks spend millions upgrading masts and installing new ones. Ofcom’s research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts EE, which is the subject of a £12.5 billion ($18.5 billion) takeover by BT, on top. EE’s 4G network, which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses, delivered the fastest average download speed of 18.6Mbit/s . The Ofcom figures are based on 120,000 smartphone tests in five sample towns and cities - Edinburgh, Leeds, London, Newcastle and Poole/Bournemouth - between October and December. Its study found that download speeds in Edinburgh fell by 12.5 per cent between the summer and end of last year. The time to call up a web page improved marginally from 0.8 seconds to 0.72. Ofcom admitted: ‘As more people are taking 4G services from the mobile operators, this is likely to affect the average speeds being received.’ The speeds for London were unchanged over the same period, while there was no data for the other areas. Claudio Pollack, Ofcom’s Consumer Director, said the study is designed to boost competition by helping consumers decide which mobile networks are offer the best service. He said: ‘People are increasingly connected, communicating and sharing content on their mobiles when out and about. ‘4G is delivering a significantly enhanced mobile experience and, as these services roll out across the UK, our research will support consumers when choosing the right mobile package for their needs.’',\n",

'We are taking this step out of an abundance of caution to ensure that we are doing everything possible to provide our consumers with safe products and to preserve the trust we have built with them and their families for more than a century,' the company said in a statement. Last month, the company and health officials said a 3-ounce cup of ice cream contaminated with listeriosis was traced to a plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Scroll down for video . Blue Bell Ice Cream has suspended operations at an Oklahoma production facility that officials had previously connected to a foodborne illness linked to the deaths of three people . Ten products recalled earlier in March were from a production line at a plant the company's headquarters in Brenham, Texas . The now-recalled ice cream product - cups of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla - is not sold in retail locations and is shipped in bulk to 'institutional accounts' such as hospitals in 23 states that comprise less than 5 per cent of the company's sales. 'We recommend that consumers do not eat any Blue Bell brand products made at the company's Oklahoma facility and that retailers and institutions do not sell or serve them,' the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late Friday. Ten products recalled earlier in March were from a production line at a plant in Brenham, Texas, the company's headquarters. The recall, the first in the company's 108-year history, began when five patients at Via Christi St. Francis hospital in Wichita, Kansas, became ill with listeriosis while hospitalized at some point from December 2013 to January 2015. Officials determined at least four drank milkshakes that contained Blue Bell ice cream. Three of the patients later died. Listeriosis, also known as listeria, is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes, according to the CDC. Listeriosis, also known as listeria, is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes . The disease primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The CDC also said Friday that it has identified six patients with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 that was indistinguishable from that found in the 3-ounce cup ice cream product traced to the Oklahoma plant. Four of the six patients were hospitalized in Texas for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis, according to the CDC. The one patient for whom information is available reported eating ice cream in a Texas hospital before developing listeriosis and the Texas Department of State Health Services reported the hospital had received Blue Bell brand ice cream cups, the CDC said. The 'investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,' the CDC said. Blue Bell said it will conduct a 'careful and complete examination' of its Oklahoma plant 'to determine the exact cause of the contamination.' The company says it voluntarily shut down the plant, then notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . 'Once our investigation is complete and we have made all necessary improvements, it will return to operation,' according to the company's statement. 'Our other plants continue to operate and supply our products to retail stores and institutional customers.' The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been notified of the company's decision to voluntarily shut down the plant, Blue Bell said. In addition to the Broken Arrow plant, the company has two plants in Brenham and one in Sylacauga, Alabama. The recalled ice cream had been shipped to Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming.\",\n",

Kevin Pimentel, 12, shot dead his six-year-old brother, Brady, as they made dinner inside their mobile home in Hudson, Florida last week - before shooting his older brother in the leg and then taking his own life. The injured brother, 16-year-old Trevor, attended the boys' funeral at St. James the Apostle Catholic Church\\xa0in a wheelchair on Wednesday, while his divorced parents,\\xa0Helen Campochiaro and\\xa0Luis Pimentel, were seen receiving hugs from well-wishers  before the service. As many as 400 people attended the memorial for the boys, who would've celebrated their birthdays this week; Kevin would have turned 13 on Monday and Brady would have turned seven on Friday, the\\xa0Tampa Bay Times reported. Loss:\\xa0Kevin Pimentel, 12, (left) shot dead his six-year-old brother, Brady, (right) before taking his own life in their Florida home as they made dinner last week. The two boys were laid to rest on Thursday . Mourners leave the funeral in Port Richey, Florida as the boys' older brother Trevor Pimentel, 16, who was shot in the leg in the incident, is helped into a waiting limo. The three boys had been home alone at the time . At the service, the Reverend Mike Cormier said the boys were now 'at the world's greatest sleepover'. The youngsters died while they were home with their 16-year-old brother. Their mother, who works two jobs to keep the family afloat, and another brother, 18, were not home at the time. Officials said there was no argument or incident that sparked the gunfire. According to a statement the Pasco County Sheriff's Office released on Thursday, Kevin was making dinner in the family's  home  and asked his older brother, Trevor, to help. Using a gun kept on the top shelf in a closet area of the family's mobile home, Kevin then shot Brady in Brady's room, Trevor told police. After wounding his older brother in the leg, he then turned the gun on himself. The deaths came just one day after their mother, 38, set up an account on gofundme, appealing for support for her family. On the page, she explained she had been left injured and financially drained by a recent car crash and needed to find a new place to live within two weeks. Grief-stricken: The boys' mother Helen Campochiaro is pictured with Kevin (center) and Brady (right). The single mother to four boys was at one of her two jobs at the time of the shootings . Remembered: Flowers and pictures of the boys were displayed inside\\xa0St. James the Apostle Catholic Church . 'The mother's going through an absolute living hell right now,' Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said the day after the boys died. Authorities said they have found no evidence that child welfare officials or police had ever been called to the home before the shooting. Campochiaro is a hard-working woman who had two jobs so she could take care of her boys and after the car crash, she didn't even go to the hospital because she had to work, Nocco said. On her Facebook page she says that she makes themed cakes and is a seamstress. Helen's sister, Barbara Campochiaro, of Spring Hill, told The Tampa Bay Times the children 'were raised with gun safety' and that Helen owned a firearm, though she was not sure what kind. 'She was a single mom with four boys. Unfortunately, she could only afford to live in a trailer,' Campochiaro said. 'She just had it (a gun) for protection.' Victims: Six-year-old Brady (left) was killed in the shooting, while Trevor, 16 (right), was shot in the leg . The boys' father, Luis Pimentel, said he didn't know his ex-wife, from whom he separated in 2012, kept a weapon in the home. In an interview with Fox13, he said that he had noticed Kevin was becoming withdrawn and no longer wanted to take part in family activities. He said he saw him getting angry at Brady over small things. 'I didn't get into it with Kevin,' he said. 'I didn't want to have any confrontation with him. I let him do what he wanted to do. I should have maybe disciplined him a little more.' He said the boys would spend half of their time with him and he always looked forward to their visits. 'I miss them very much,' he said. 'I love them. I will never forget them. They were my life.' Kevin was in middle school. Brady attended elementary school and Trevor took virtual high school classes at home in the mornings and culinary classes at a technical school in the afternoons. Anger: The boys' father, Luis Pimentel, said he had noticed Kevin getting angrier and more withdrawn . Scene: The shooting unfolded in the family's mobile home at the\\xa0Sugar Lane park mobile home in Hudson . 'Me and my boys have had to start over from uncontrolled circumstances,too many times,' she wrote on the gofundme page. 'Divorce,theft, abuse ... I have sold almost everything I own to make a better life for my boys,more than once.' Campichiaro also alluded to having to leave her children at home while she worked. 'I regretfully feel like I never see my boys,' she wrote. 'They are so good and so understanding.They do more than their share at home and for me.Least I can do is put them in a good home.I believe in paying it forward and try to do my part everyday.' The page has raised nearly $7,000. Friends of Campachiaro have set up a separate fundraiser for her on Give Forward, which has already received more than $13,000 in donations. 'She is a devoted mom, an extremely hard worker, and an incredible business woman,' the page says of Campachiaro. 'Please help raise money for her family, for her son in the hospital recovering, and many, many expenses. Two of her sons were killed while she was at work, anything helps.'

These drinks often contain high amounts of alcohol and drinking too many of them can leave your head spinning... or worse. Scroll down for video . Colourful cocktails are deceptively easy to drink but can sometimes contain vast quantities of alcohol . The Zombie is a fruity cocktail made from three different types of rum, lime juice, falernum, Angostura bitters, Pernod, grenadine, cinnamon syrup and grapefruit juice . Made with high-proof alcohol and hardly any mixers, these ten cocktails are sure to floor even the hardiest of drinker. From Jungle Juice and Caribou Lou to Negroni, Death In The Afternoon and Sazerac, Femail reveals the 10 most alcoholic cocktails in the world. According to drinkaware.co.uk, men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day. Women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day. One alcohol unit  equals one 25ml single measure of spirits. 1. Zombie . A smooth, fruity cocktail originally served heated, the Zombie was concocted in the 1930s by Donn Beach, a restaurant owner in Hollywood. The cocktail's ingredients were a heavily guarded secret. However, according to the original recipe, published in drinks book Sippin' Safari, the drink was made from three different kinds of rum, lime juice, falernum, Angostura bitters, Pernod, grenadine, and 'Don's Mix,' a combination of cinnamon syrup and grapefruit juice. The cocktail is so strong that Don The Beachcomber restaurants limit their customers to two Zombies apiece. What makes this so alcoholic? Three types of rum: 40 per cent ABV . Pernod: 40 per cent ABV . Angostura bitters: 44.7 per cent ABV . 2. Jungle Juice . This cocktail is made fresh fruits which have been steeped overnight in an entirely bottle of grain alcohol before being served up, in the style of punch, to unsuspecting drinkers. The recipe for this particular drink comes from The Bartender’s Black Book by Stephen Kittredge Cunningham. To bring down the alcohol levels, you can add a mixer like lemonade although this is frowned upon. Connoisseurs say that when it is made correctly it doesn't taste anything like alcohol at all. What makes this so alcoholic? 1 litre bottle of grain alcohol: 95 per cent ABV . 3. Death In The Afternoon . A classic concoction of champagne and absinthe, this luxe cocktail was invented by Ernest Hemingway and is also called Hemingway Champagne. Relatively simple to make, the recipe's original instructions appear in 1935 cocktail book and were contributed by Hemingway himself, who wrote: 'Pour one jigger absinthe into a champagne glass. Add iced champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.' The drink rarely appears on menus but can be ordered from bartenders.

Considered by some to be the strongest cocktail in the world, this drink contains 100 per cent alcohol, with absolutely no mixers. Gin, vodka, absinthe, brandy and blackberry liquor are mixed together in equal parts for a dastardly drink that will certainly pack a punch. According to folklore, the drink was created by the mixed-race daughter of a slave owner in 1800s Alabama. Roberta was said to have fled her abusive home before turning to prostitution. She then moved on to the moonshine business where she used to sell this drink to her customers looking to drown their sorrows. What makes this so alcoholic . Gin: 40 per cent alcohol .

Typically an after-dinner drink, the Russian Nicolashka comprises a double shot of vodka, espresso powder, lemon and sugar. The concoction is consumed by first putting the lemon, sugar and coffee in the mouth, before taking one shot of vodka. The mixture is kept in the mouth and slowly chewed before being swallowed. The second shot of vodka comes swiftly after. It's a relatively simple drink but is strong, with drinkers claiming that keeping the alcohol in the mouth allows it to be absorbed faster into the blood stream. And while booze itself is said to slow the circulation, caffeine from the espresso, together with the vitamin C from the lemon, combine with the sugar to increase blood circulation, making the alcohol reach the brain swiftly.

The recipe here calls for between two to four ounces of Peychaud’s Bitters and two ounces of rye whiskey, with one cube of sugar. But what elevates this cocktail is the coating of absinthe on the inside of the chilled glass, which adds extra potency to the drink. The higher the alcohol content of the whisky you use, the more lethal the drink becomes. What makes this so alcoholic . Rye whiskey: 80 per cent ABV .

              " {'sequence': \"Aliens are often portrayed as diminutive beings, but in ‘reality’ they could be much larger and heavier than science fiction films suggest. Scientist Fergus Simpson has calculated the minimum size needed for intelligent life to survive, based on the laws of conservation of energy seen on Earth. And from this, he calculates that if intelligent extraterrestrials exist they will typically weigh 650lbs (300kg) - the median weight of a polar bear. Aliens (illustrated with a stock image) are often portrayed as diminutive beings, but in ‘reality’ they could be much larger, one scientist claims. Fergus Simpson from University of Barcelona applied a mathematical formula to assume aliens obey the same laws of conservation of energy as animals  on Earth . Mr Simpson came to this conclusion by applying a mathematical formula that assumes aliens obey the same laws of conservation of energy as animals do on Earth. This means that larger animals need more resources to survive, so are less common than plentiful ants, for example. The cosmologist’s calculations are also based on the idea that there’s a minimum size needed for intelligent life, but don’t factor in an alien planet’s gravity. ‘Throughout the animal kingdom, species which are physically larger invariably possess a lower population density, possibly due to their enhanced energy demands,’ he wrote in a paper, published at\\xa0arXiv.org. He said there must be a minimum body size necessary for supporting intelligent life, based on the range of body sizes of intelligent animals such as apes and humans, found on Earth. ‘As a result, we should expect humans to be physically smaller than most other advanced species.’ '...we conclude that most species are expected to exceed 300kg in body mass. The median body mass is similar to that of a polar bear.' He claims that just as it is on Earth, there are probably more small animals than larger ones in the universe, but that the larger a planet or biosphere the more likely it is to have evolved an intelligent species. Mr Simpson said there must be a minimum size necessary for supporting intelligent life, based on the range of body sizes of intelligent animals such as apes and humans, found on Earth. And, if they exist, he believes intelligent aliens typically weigh more than 650 lbs (300kg) - around the size of a polar bear (stock image) His argument follows that if clever aliens are large, there may be fewer of them, as they will likely live in a society with low population densities to ensure they have the resources they need. Study claims aliens are larger than those portrayed in sci-fi (stock image). But the calculations don't take into account an alien planet’s surface gravity . Commenting on the study, Duncan Forgan, a Research Fellow at the University of St Andrews, told NewsWeek:  ‘I think the average size calculation is reasonable’. Seth Shostak, a researcher at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, added that it is not the first time scientists have suggested that aliens may be large, because big animals tend to live longer. A longer lifespan makes creatures potentially more likely to develop knowledge and invent technology needed to make contact with humans one day. Mr Simpson continued: ‘Higher intelligence enables the development of technologies which can sustain larger population sizes.’ While the research has been described as interesting by Dr Shostak, he said ‘there’s no concrete data to work with’ and that Earth is being used as a model to predict what life looks like elsewhere in the universe – but aliens may be completely different. He pointed out that it is humans’ thumbs, bipedal stance and brains, rather than our bulk, that has enabled us to thrive on Earth, so body mass is only one indicator of intelligence. ‘Polar bears are large but do not write great literature and build radio towers and a lot of that is probably because they are walking around on all fours,’ he said. Mr Forgan also noted that the research doesn’t take an alien planet’s surface gravity into account. He explained that planets with stronger gravity might be expected to be home to smaller life forms than those with weaker gravity, which means that the calculation is incomplete.\",\n",

Winning this amount of money would change anyone but we are going to try and stay grounded and live the way we\\'ve always done.\\' Mr Maxwell said his experience had inspired some of his fundraising and added that his motorcycling group has raised £50,000 for Macmillan nurses in the last three years.

              " {'sequence': \"Two states at the center of gay rights protests over laws designed to 'uphold religious freedom' engaged in hurried climbdowns yesterday, with both approving alterations to legislation that critics said legalized discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 'Now that this is behind us, let's move forward together with a renewed commitment to the civility and respect that make this state great,' Indiana Governor Mike Pence said after signing his state's amended measure. The Arkansas legislature also passed changes to its legislation at the behest of the state's Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson, who rejected a previous version of the bill at the last minute on Wednesday following public uproar and a personal plea from his son. Hutchinson signed the new legislation last night. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signs a reworked religious freedom bill into law on Thursday evening. Lawmakers in Arkansas and Indiana hoped that by amending their states' measures they would quiet the national uproar over new religious objections that opponents say are designed to offer a legal defense for anti-gay discrimination . 'Now that this is behind us, let's move forward together with a renewed commitment to the civility and respect that make this state great,' Indiana Governor Mike Pence said after signing his state's amended measure Thursday evening . Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma speaks at a press conference announcing changes to the state's religious freedom law as Senate President Pro Tem David Long, left, looks on. The GOP leaders on Thursday added anti-discrimination safeguards to the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act . 'I think it’s sending the right signal, the way this has been resolved, to the world and the country that Arkansas understands the diversity of our culture and workforce but also the importance of balancing that with our sincerely held religious convictions,' Hutchinson said. The recently empowered governor also suggested he'd issue an executive order banning discrimination in the workplace for state employees, according to a\\xa0CNN\\xa0report. The two, GOP-controlled states were in a frenzy this week to quell national outrage over legislation meant to satisfy evangelicals who do not believe they should be compelled by the government to provide goods and services to certain customers if doing so would violate their religious convictions. The moves had the direct effect of upsetting gay and lesbian individuals, however, and incited massive protests. After gay rights activists, sympathetic businesses and celebrities thrust the measures into the national spotlight, both states found themselves in the cross-hairs, and even Republican lawmakers began to distance themselves from the laws as written. Republican leaders in the Hoosier State conceded this week to critics arguing that their state's law, signed into effect by Governor Mike Pence a week ago today, inadvertently left room for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 'It was never intended to discriminate against anyone,' Indiana Senate President Pro Tem David Long said at a Thursday morning at a press conference. Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma, standing alongside Long, said, 'Hoosier hospitality had to be restored.' 'It is causing real harm to real people right now in our state. I'm not talking about those who feel their rights are being infringed, I'm talking about commerce in a major, major way,' Bosma said of the law Thursday . Acknowledging that the changes to the law won't necessarily satisfy religious groups, he said, 'we had to be prompt. We had to be swift.' Opponents of an Arkansas religious objection measure chant 'We Are Arkansas' as they face the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson earlier that day said he wants the legislature to either recall the bill from his desk or pass a follow-up measure that would make the proposal more closely mirror a 1993 federal religious-freedom law . In addition to the already protected classes of persons, the new language specifies that businesses,\\xa0individuals and other providers cannot refuse to do business with persons on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. No one has the legal right to 'refuse to offer or provide' goods, services, facilities or employment to anyone for those reasons, it says. Exempted from the new rules, however, are churches and non-profit religious organizations, including schools. After adamantly defending the state's law in the national press, Pence suddenly said Tuesday that 'it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone.' The 180 earned him the mocking of the White House, which described him as a 'previously defiant governor' who changed his position after a 'bipartisan and even nonpolitical outcry.' Pence said Thursday he believed the move to change the legislation was in the best way forward for his state. 'There will be some who think this legislation goes too far and some who think it does not go far enough, but as governor I must always put the interest of our state first and ask myself every day, 'What is best for Indiana?' Pence said in a statement. 'I believe resolving this controversy and making clear that every person feels welcome and respected in our state is best for Indiana.' Demonstrators hold signs on the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol thanking Hutchinson for calling for changes to the religious freedom measure.\\xa0A new version of Arkansas' law is now making its way through the statehouse. The altered bill would more closely mirror federal legislation . The new version of Arkansas' law  more closely mirrors federal legislation. The fixes passed the state's Senate Wednesday night and its House Thursday. Hutchinson on Wednesday had requested the legislative changes, saying he could not sign the bill until they were made. 'How do we as a state communicate to the world that we are respectful of a diverse workplace and we want to be known as a state that does not discriminate but understands tolerance?' he said during a press conference outside the state Capitol. 'That is the challenge we face. Making this law like the federal law will aid us in that effort in communication, but also was my original objective from the beginning.' Upon signing the bill Thursday, Hutchinson said, 'I know it's been a contentious debate.' 'We resolved it in an Arkansas way and in the right way for our country and for the people of Arkansas.' Hutchinson said he recognizes this is not the end of the debate, 'but the fact that it might not solve every problem for everyone probably means it's a good bill.' Conservative lawmakers said they didn't appreciate the slap in the face from Hutchinson, who had said numerous times in the past that he would approve the legislation in its current form when it reached his desk, but they worked to make the necessary adjustments just the same. 'I don't feel it was right for the governor to say he was going to sign something that he watched all the way through and didn't sign,' state senator Terry Rice told Arkansas Online. 'I know things come up at the last minute but now we have hodgepodged some bills together.' That sentiment was shared by Arkansas Family Council, a group that favors the law and pushed to get it passed. 'I'm very puzzled at this point to see why the bill would need to be amended at this late date, considering everybody in the chamber has had a chance to see it,' Jerry Cox, the group's leader, said. 'I think it's been thoroughly vetted, and it's a good law.' A family-owned pizzeria in Indiana that said it wouldn't cater same-sex weddings shut down until further notice on Wednesday after the owners received threatening phone calls, and the establishment's YELP page was flooded with bad reviews . Indiana, the first of the two states to pass the offending religious liberty legislation, saw a fierce backlash over the weekend and early this week that included thousands of protesters descending on the state Capitol and a prominent local business cancelling a planned $40 million expansion of its headquarters after Pence formally approved the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Hutchinson, who took office just two months ago, seeking to avoid an uprising of equal intensity in his own state, pushed legislators in Arkansas to make adjustments to their bill before he put his name on it. The Arkansas-based retail corporation Wal-Mart publicly lobbied the Republican politician not to approve the bill, labeling it as discriminatory. Meanwhile, in Indiana, a family-owned pizzeria, Memories, that said it wouldn't cater same-sex weddings shut down until further notice on Wednesday after the owners received threatening phone calls and the establishment's YELP page was flooded with bad reviews.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Three Ku Klux Klan members who worked at a Florida prison have been charged with plotting to kill a black inmate after his release because they believed the man is infected with HIV and hepatitis and he bit one of them during a fight, officials said Thursday. The case comes as the latest black eye for the troubled state prison system. The three men - Thomas Jordan Driver, 25, David Elliot Moran, 47, and Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42 - were arrested Thursday and each faces one state count of conspiracy to commit murder, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi\\'s office said in a written statement. The state said the murder plot started after Driver, an officer at the Department of Corrections Reception and Medical Center in rural north Florida, had a fight with the inmate. Moran is currently a sergeant at that facility. Newcomb was fired in 2013 for failing to meet training requirements, according to the department. Charged: (From left to right) Charles Thomas Newcomb, Thomas Jordan Driver, and David Elliot Moran each were arrested Thursday on one state count of conspiracy to commit murder, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi\\'s office said . Bondi\\'s office said the three were also members of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The group has garnered attention in recent months for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists. The FBI was initially alerted to the murder plot by a confidential informant inside the Klan, according to an arrest affidavit. The FBI\\'s affidavit described the informant as \\'a confidential human source for the FBI whose motivation for cooperation with the FBI is patriotism.\\' The informant was present when Driver and Moran talked with Newcomb, identified as the KKK chapter\\'s \\'Exalted Cyclops\\' or leader, and recorded many of their conversations. In late 2014, authorities say Driver provided the Klan chapter, called a klavern, with a photograph of the inmate, who\\'d been let out on supervised release. \\'Both Driver and Moran ... told the (confidential informant) that they wanted (the inmate) \"six feet under,\"\\' the FBI\\'s affidavit said. The informant recorded all three men making plans to murder the inmate - ranging from shooting him to injecting with a lethal dose of insulin, which Newcomb said \\'would be quieter.\\'\\xa0In the recordings, the men often refer to the man using a racial epithet. The affidavit said the informant, Moran and Newcomb went on a trip together to where the inmate lives in Palatka. Before they made the trip, \\'Newcomb pointed out that if they could grab (the inmate) and take him to the river, he would need to bring a fishing pole to make it look like (the inmate) was at the river fishing,\\' the affidavit said. \\'Newcomb told (the informant) he wanted to make it as realistic as possible, but if they had to go in there blazin, they would do what they had to do,\\' the affidavit continued. Their first attempt to find and kill the inmate failed. \\'The FBI pre-arranged to have a law enforcement presence in the area of (the inmate\\'s) residence to prevent a crime being committed that day,\\' the affidavit said. \\'A vehicle with police lights was staged on the same street a block away from (the inmate\\'s) residence and a police patrol vehicle aggressively roved the neighborhood to establish an active law enforcement response.\\' The informant later recorded a conversation with Driver to confirm he still wanted him dead. \\'Okay, but do you want this guy terminated?\\' the informant asked. \\'I think for this individual...I think a message isn\\'t going to do him any good,\\' Driver replied, according to the affidavit. \\'Okay so I take that as a yes?\\' the informant said. \\'Yes sir,\\' Driver said, according to the affidavit. In March, the FBI gave the informant a burner cellphone with a doctored photograph that appeared to show the inmate had been fatally shot. The informant showed all three men the photograph and recorded their jubilant reactions. \\'According to (the informant), Newcomb smiled upon seeing the photograph that depicted that (the inmate) had been shot and killed,\\' the affidavit said. Moran, whom the men referred to as \\'Sarge,\\' was smiling when he saw the photograph that depicted the inmate had been murdered, according to the informant. \\'Moran also gave (the informant) an enthusiastic handshake upon seeing the photograph,\\' according to the affidavit. \\'Driver smiled, nodded his head in a yes motion and shook the (informant\\'s) hand in gratitude,\\' according to the affidavit. Bondi said and corrections department officials were quick to condemn the suspects\\' alleged actions, but the incident highlights an ongoing stream of high-profile problems in Florida\\'s prison system. Last fall, prison system officials fired nearly 50 employees, including several over allegations that they punched and beat inmates. The deaths of inmates Randall Jordan-Aparo and Darren Rainey also drew attention. Jordan-Aparo was reportedly gassed while in a confinement cell at the Franklin Correctional Institution. Rainey, a mentally ill prisoner, was punished in 2012 with a shower so hot that his skin separated from his body at Dade Correctional Institution. The warden there was fired. Reaching out: The American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has garnered attention for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists. A recent flyer from the Klan provided by\\xa0WTXL-TV is seen here . Incident:\\xa0The state said the murder plotting started after Driver, an officer at the Department of Corrections Reception and Medical Center (pictured) in rural north Florida, had a fight with the inmate . Department of Corrections Secretary Julie Jones, who was hired late last year to lead the troubled agency, called the arrests \\'disquieting.\\' \\'We are moving swiftly to terminate the employees arrested today and working closely with Office of the Attorney General to assist in their prosecution,\\' she said in a written statement. \\'Our Department has zero tolerance for racism or prejudice of any kind. The actions of these individuals are unacceptable and do not, in any way, represent the thousands of good, hardworking honorable correctional officers employed at the Department of Corrections.\\' The case will be prosecuted in Columbia County in north Florida. Driver and Moran are being held in Union County jail. Newcomb is in Alachua County Jail with bond set at $750,000. Frank Ancona, imperial wizard of the KKK group to which the three men were said to belong, did not confirm or deny their membership. \\'We at the TAK do not in any way condone, tolerate, or support any type of illegal activity in our organization and because of this we would stand by any of our members pending a decision by a court of law, not a decision of the court of media or public opinion,\\' Ancona said.',\n",

              " {'sequence': \"One in three GP training places  remain empty, it emerged today, sparking concerns patients will struggle more than ever to access a family doctor. While the Government is desperately trying to recruit more GPs, medical leaders warn the speciality has become unfashionable as junior doctors fear being overworked. The news comes amid a chronic shortage of doctors, and last week it was revealed that 10 per cent of patients tried - and failed - to book a GP appointment in 2013/14. Access to a GP is about to get even worse, as new figures show a third of GP training posts remain unfilled . This means patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year. Each August, junior doctors with two years experience after medical school begin training as either a GP or a hospital doctor. This year, 29 per cent of GP trainee places remain unfilled, at a time when there is already a shortage of doctors. In some parts of the UK, more than 60 per cent of positions remain unfilled,\\xa0sparking fears patients may struggle to see their GP. The figures, from the GP National Recruitment office website, were disclosed in an investigation by Pulse magazine. Overall, they show that more than 1,000 GP training posts are vacant. In the East Midlands, 64 per cent of posts are unfilled, with 63 per cent vacancy rate in the North East of England. In the West Midlands 47 per cent of posts are empty and across the south Coast 41 per cent of places remain unfilled. In 2013, the last time figures are available, there was a vacancy rate for GP trainee posts of 8 per cent at the same point in the recruitment process. Of the 12 areas across the England, Scotland and Wales, only London managed to fill its vacancies in the first round of recruitment. Doctors warn the figures mean we may be headed for a recruitment crisis, as there is already a shortage of doctors in many parts of the country . Two other areas – Kent, Surrey & Sussex and Thames Valley are expected to do so in the next round of recruitment. Dr Krishna Kasaraneni, chair of the British Medical Association's GP education committee told\\xa0the Telegraph\\xa0the figures show the country is headed towards a 'crisis' in GP recruitment. He said: 'We saw a significant decline last year and this is looking even worse – with more and more GPs retiring and not being replaced, we are heading towards a major recruitment crisis.' In many parts of the country, patients are struggling to get access to their GP because there are too few doctors. He said: 'Some practices are having to close their doors, others are reducing the level of service, because there just aren't enough doctors and ever more demands on them,' he said. He added junior doctors are opting to become hospital doctors instead of GPs as they fear they will be overburdened by work as a family doctor. The figures will be a blow Health Education England, the body responsible for GP recruitment, who had set a target to recruit 50 per cent of junior doctors to become GP trainees by 2016. They were already forced to push back their deadline for this target by a year, after applications for GP training fell in 2014. In 2014, after three rounds of recruitment, there was an overall vacancy rate of 12 per cent for GP training posts.\",\n",

He hugged tearful family members as he walked out and was embraced by his sister, Darlene Gardner. His sister\\xa0sobbed as she hugged her brother: 'Thank you Lord, thank you Jesus.' Scroll down for video . Freedom: Anthony Ray Hinton (center) walked free from the Jefferson County Jail in Alabama on Friday morning after 30 years on death row . Hinton had to wipe away a tear as he spoke outside the jail following his release from prison after 30 years . Hinton says he should not have had to wait 30 years for investigators to test the gun that was seized from his home and determine he could not be linked to the crime . Good morning. The sun do shine. Thirty years ago, the prosecution seemed deemed to take my life from me. They just didn't take me from my family and friends. They had every intention of executing me for something I didn't do. But for all of you that's snapping the cameras, I want you to know there is a God. He sits high but He looks low. He will destroy but yet He will defend and He defends me. And I just want to thank Him. I'm not ashamed to let you know that He sent me not just a lawyer, but the best lawyers.\\xa0And I couldn't have made it without them. And I want to say to the victims' family, I will continue to pray for you as I have for 30 years. A miscarriage of justice, not only to me, but the victims' family. For all of us that say we believe in justice, this is the case to start showing. Because I shouldn't sit on death row for 30 years. All they had to do was test the gun. But when you think you high and mighty and you above the law, you don't have to answer to nobody. But I've got news for you. Everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God . Hinton was freed after prosecutors admitted earlier this week that they couldn't find evidence that a gun found at his home fired the bullets used in two brutal 1985 murders. 'I shouldn't have sat on death row for 30 years,' Hinton told reporters. 'All they had to do was test the gun,' he said. Hinton had strong words about the prosecutors and jury as he spoke to the crowd. 'I want you to know there is a God. He sits high but he looks low. He will destroy but yet he will defend and he defended me,' Hinton told the gathered. 'I shouldn't have sat on death row 30 years. All they had to do was test the gun. But when you think you are high and mighty and you're above the law you don't have to answer to nobody, but I've got news for you. Everybody who played a part in sending me to death row you will answer to God.' His attorney Brian Stevenson said: 'Mr. Hinton has spent 30 years locked in an 5-by-8 cell and with the state of Alabama trying to kill him every day.' The newly freed man added that is a miscarriage of justice for the victims and their families. The family of one of the men who Hinton was convicted of killing was less happy. He told the Birmingham News that he was not declared innocent - only that there was not enough evidence to uphold his conviction. 'This is a difficult time for my family and at this time the only thing I have to say is God will have the ultimate decision on if he is guilty or not,' said Jason Davidson, the son of John Davidson. Friends say Hinton's first request after his release - finding a buffet to fill up on all the food he missed in prison. Hinton was convicted of the 1985 murders of two Birmingham fast-food restaurant managers. Crime scene bullets were the only evidence that linked Hinton to the crime. However, prosecutors said this week that modern forensic methods did not show the fatal bullets came from a revolver in Hinton's home, or even from the same gun.

'Thank you Lord, than you Jesus,' she could be heard saying . In this undated photo from the Alabama DOC shows Hinton after several years in prison . Hinton said he would continue to pray for the victims' families, as this was a miscarriage of justice for them as well. 'They had every intention of executing me for something I didn't do,' Hinton said. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that Hinton had inadequate counsel and sent the case back for a second trial. Prosecutors had been preparing for a retrial but moved to dismiss the case following the testing on the bullets. The Supreme Court ruled last year that Hinton had 'constitutionally deficient' representation at his initial trial. Hinton's defense lawyer wrongly thought he had only $1,000 to hire a ballistics expert to try to rebut the prosecution testimony about the bullets. The lawyer hired the only person willing to take the job at that price, even though he had concerns about the expert's credentials. At the time, jurors chuckled as the defense expert struggled to answer questions on cross-examination. Bryan Stevenson, Hinton's attorney and director of the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative, said he pressed the state for years to re-test the gun, and for years officials refused. He said the case was emblematic of problems with the justice system. Stevenson has said Hinton was convicted based on bad science because he didn't have the money to prove his innocence at trial. 'He was convicted because he was poor,' Stevenson, who first took on the case 16 years ago, said Friday. Hinton was greeted by his emotional family members immediately as he walked out of jail as a free man.

              " {'sequence': \"Sacked: But Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the incident which got him sacked from Top Gear . Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the attack on a Top Gear producer which led to him being sacked from the hit BBC show. Police had opened an investigation into the incident, which took place at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire last month after Clarkson had been filming Top Gear in the area. However, after the victim Oisin Tymon said that he did not want to press charges, officers have now decided to drop the probe without taking action against Clarkson. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘North Yorkshire Police has now completed its routine enquiries following the incident at Hawes involving Mr Jeremy Clarkson, and we will not be pursuing this matter any further. ‘North Yorkshire Police takes a thorough and victim-led approach to all investigations. ‘Last week, the person at the centre of the incident, Mr Tymon, said that he did not wish the police to take action on his behalf. ‘However, at that point we still needed to speak to some members of the public who were present at the time of the incident, who had been affected by the event, and whose views also needed to be considered. ‘Now that all the interviews are complete, we have properly established that there is no need for further police action.’ The incident, described as a 'fracas' by BBC officials, occurred when Clarkson discovered that the hotel where he was staying could not serve him a hot meal following a day's filming. An official report found that the 54-year-old presenter punched Mr Tymon in the mouth before being dragged away by a witness, causing the producer to go to A&E for emergency treatment. He also verbally abused him for 20 minutes, blaming Mr Tymon for failing to ensure that he could get a steak at the hotel. Victim: Oisin Tymon told police he did not wish to press charges against Mr Clarkson . Mr Clarkson was suspended as Top Gear presenter as soon as news of the fight came to light, and after the report was released the BBC announced that it would not renew his contract. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately, and the producer told North Yorkshire Police he did not want to see Mr Clarkson prosecuted. Despite his sacking, Mr Clarkson is set to take part in a series of Top Gear Live shows alongside co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May, although the performances will be rebranded. The BBC has said that Top Gear is likely to continue in some form, but Mr Hammond and Mr May are not expected to return. The star initially received widespread public support - including from his friend, Prime Minister David Cameron - in the aftermath of the incident, while one million people signed a petition calling for the BBC to reinstate him. Trio: Mr Clarkson is still set to appear in Top Gear live shows alongside Richard Hammond and James May . But director-general Tony Hall said 'a line has been crossed' and that 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Lord Hall has faced death threats since he announced that Mr Clarkson would be sacked, and has had bodyguards assigned to protect him and his family. It is not yet known what Mr Clarkson's next move will be - he has been linked with a move to another channel, while the decision to continue the live shows has prompted speculation that he could continue to work with Mr Hammond and Mr May. It has also been suggested that Top Gear boss Andy Wilman, a childhood friend of Mr Clarkson, could be leaving the show, after an email to staff which was widely interpreted as a farewell to Top Gear was leaked last week. Last week it emerged that Mr Hammond and Mr May were each selling off several classic motorbikes from their extensive collections. The 12 cycles have a guide price estimate of £66,000, but the novelty value could push up the price far beyond that - though Mr May insisted the sale was not linked to Mr Clarkson's dismissal. The co-presenter has mocked his own newfound unemployment since the incident, recently posting a video of cooking tips in which he instructs viewers how to make a shepherd's pie.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Fear of spiders is a survival trait written into our DNA, researchers have discovered. Dating back hundreds of thousands of years, the instinct to avoid arachnids developed as an evolutionary response to a dangerous threat, the academics suggest. It could mean that arachnophobia, one of the most crippling of phobias, represents a finely tuned survival instinct. And it could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom have existed millions of years ago. Scroll down for video . Researchers say a fear of spiders is a survival trait written into our DNA and dates back thousands of years, Stock photo . Study leader Joshua New, of Columbia University in New York, said: ‘A number of spider species with potent, vertebratespecific venoms populated Africa long before hominoids and have co-existed there for tens of millions of years. ‘Humans were at perennial, unpredictable and significant risk of encountering highly venomous spiders in their ancestral environments. ‘Even when not fatal, a black widow spider bite in the ancestral world could leave one incapacitated for days or even weeks, terribly exposed to dangers,’ he told the Sunday Times. The research team carried out an experiment in which 252 volunteers were asked to study computer screens containing abstract shapes and data. Their reactions to images of spiders were very fast, even if their shape was distorted, when compared to much more clear images of other objects known induce disgust or fear, such as needles and flies. The researchers point out that spiders are often small dark creatures that tend to hide in recesses and are hard to spot. Dr New said: ‘Detection, therefore, is the critical arbiter of success in such encounters — any improvements to the sensitivity, vigilance, reliability and speed of faculties for their detection would have been of significant selective advantage.’ The instinct could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom existed millions of years ago.

The HM Customs cutter Valiant, which was on the water nearby, and was able to locate the upturned vessel within minutes and spotted a red flare. A Coastguard spokesman said that the cutter stood by the vessel, ensuring the safety of those in the water, until an RNLI lifeboat from Dungeness arrived to pick the couple up from the water and take them ashore. They were taken to the William Harvey Hospital by the rescue helicopter from RAF Watisham. The spokesman said the pair were 'cold and shaken by the ordeal' but unharmed.

Bob Giles, Dover Coastguard Watch Manager said: 'The couple were thrown into the water after their vessel capsized. 'Both were wearing lifejackets and the man ensured that his partner was safe, then tied a rope around himself and dived under the vessel to retrieve a flare so that he could alert rescuers to their position. 'Because they had AIS (automatic identification system) on board they were easy to locate and so were rescued quickly. 'The member of the public who made the first call to the Coastguard did exactly the right thing by calling 999 and asking for the Coastguard. It meant that we were able to get rescuers to the scene within minutes of the vessel capsizing.'\",\n",

A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed that the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick, and invested in employment schemes, the more likely its residents were to want a job. A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick the more likely its residents were to want a job.\\xa0In Norway, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80% of people wanted a job. In Estonia, one of least generous, only around 40% did . In Norway in particular, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80 per cent of people wanted a job, . By contrast in Estonia, one of the least generous countries, only around 40 per cent did. The survey was carried out by sociologists Dr Kjetil van der Wel and Dr Knut Halvorsen from Oslo and Akershus University College. They examined responses to the statement: 'I would enjoy having a paid job even if I did not need the money' put to the interviewees for the European Social Survey in 2010. People who are hungry are more inclined to support of the welfare state policies that help the poor. The extraordinary results of a recent study from Aarhus University found that the state of our bodies has a significant influence on our position on specific political issues. Researchers said people's support for apparently altruistic policies of wealth redistribution is not so much a reflection of concern for the poor but 'rather a strategy for securing further resources for themselves.' And they their findings could revolutionise perceptions of how people come to adopt a political stance, with our ideological views apparently swayed by basic biology. These responses were then compared with the amount the countries spent on welfare benefits and employment schemes, while taking into account the population differences between the member states. The UK was average for the generosity of benefits, which was reflected in the percentage of people agreeing with the statement at almost 60 per cent. The researchers also found that governments that intervene  to help the unemployed find work made people in general more likely to agree that they wanted work even if they didn't need the money. 'Many scholars and commentators fear that generous social benefits threaten the sustainability of the welfare state due to work norm erosion, disincentives to work and dependency cultures,' the researchers said in the paper, 'The bigger the worse? A comparative study of the welfare state and employment commitment'. 'A basic assumption is that if individuals can obtain sufficient levels of well-being - economic, social and psychological - from living off public benefits, compared to being employed, they would prefer the former. The UK was average for the generosity of benefits and this was reflected in the percentage of people wanting to work - at 60% (stock image pictured). The study also found that governments that intervene to help the unemployed find work made people more likely to say they wanted work even if they didn't need the money . 'When a 'critical mass' of individuals receive public benefits rather than engaging in paid work, the norms regulating work and benefit behaviour will weaken, setting off a self-reinforcing process towards the 'self-destruction' of the welfare state. They also said that this may be because people who receive generous benefits when out of work may feel more inclined to give something back to the state by striving hard to find work. 'The notion that big welfare states are associated with widespread cultures of dependency, or other adverse consequences of poor short term incentives to work, receives little support.' The paper was published in the journal Work, Employment and Society.\",\n",

The treasurer of a voluntary organisation drained £90,000 from the group's account - spending thousands on restaurant meals and trips to France. John Howard, 66, from Canterbury, Kent, had been a member of the Overseas Press and Media Association for 30 years but began stealing funds two years ago, leaving the company facing bankruptcy. The father-of-three had sole access to the non-profit organisation's account and enjoyed dining alone on several £300 meals a month and also spent money on flowers, a court heard. His fraud was only uncovered after the association had problems paying its creditors and Howard started to dodge emails and phone calls. He was jailed for two and a half years and mouthed 'I'm sorry' to a former colleague as he left the dock at Canterbury Crown Court. Prosecutor Tony Prosser said Howard secretly sacked auditors and then presented the association with fake accounts each month. Between 2011 to 2013 he freely dipped into the money and lavished cash on himself and his family. When his crime came to light just £180 was left in the association's savings account when it should have been nearly £80,000. Howard rang a fellow member from a pay phone admitting the fraud and offering to repay £20,000. Mr Prosser said police found he had blown thousands on meals, groceries, flowers, expenditure in France, hotels and even sending money to his wife. Howard, who admitted fraud by breach of trust, claimed he only took £67,000 and had now put his home up for sale in a bid to repay some of the money. Dominic Webber, defending, said Howard got into debt and used the money to pay bills and was 'extremely sorry for what he has done.' Matt Findel-Hawkins, a former OPMA president, said: 'It wasn't like he was paying off debts to some evil Shylock figure. This was blatant, categorical deceit over time. His fraud was only uncovered after OPMA had problems paying its creditors and Howard started to dodge emails and phone calls. The non-profit trade association services the international advertising community . 'At the same time he would sit there in meetings, smiling at us.' Mr Findel-Hawkins, sales director for Nikkei Europe, said Howard had been a member of the non-profit organisation for 30 years. He said: 'We'd have meetings and all go to lunch. He was a steady guy with a nice sense of humour. 'That's why he was our treasurer. We've been trying to work out what went wrong. If I ever spoke to him again, I'd just want to know why he did it.' Sentencing, Judge Simon James told Howard his victim was a not-for-profit organisation which had been operating for more than 80 years. 'Under your three-year tenure as treasurer - in which you seemed to treat its bank account as your own - they were left close to bankruptcy and perilously close to folding,' he said. 'Your good name has now been well and truly lost. This was a systematic, prolonged and flagrant piece of dishonesty. Howard was jailed for two and a half years and mouthed 'I'm sorry' to a former colleague as he left the dock at Canterbury Crown Court today . 'It seems to me the money was used to fund a comfortable living for you and your family rather than out of real desperation.' Detective Constable Barry Carr described it as a 'serious abuse of position' and said Howard had shown a 'flagrant disregard for the trust and responsibility placed in him'. He added that his deceit had nearly brought the long-established organisation to its knees financially. The OPMA is a non-profit trade association servicing the international advertising community, run voluntarily by its members.\",\n",

But are the contents of the bags worth the prices being paid? The official website of the Sydney Royal Easter Show lists the retail value of show bag contents, and reveals that at least one of the bags cost more than it would to buy the items outright. The 2015 Sydney Royal Easter show, which opened to the public last Thursday 26 March . The Cowboy Bag includes a toy sheriff's hat, a vest and a red bandana, as well as a toy pump action shotgun and a pack of plastic pistols and handcuffs. The price is $26. But the site lists the retail value of the items as $23.85 - and that's without the added burden of entrance fees, rides and long queues at the show. Other bags offer some rather trivial savings. At the lower end of the price scale, buyers of the Fruit Tingles bag will get three 34 gram packets of the disc-shaped lollies, one 34 gram packet of fruit pastilles, two Redskins, two lollipops and two Milko sticks for $5. That's a saving of $0.10 on the listed total retail value is $5.10. The Aussie Bogan bag - if that's your thing - offers better value. For $15 buyers will get a drinking cap with Aussie flag, a mullet wig, fake bogan teeth, Aussie pride stubby holder, and an infatable Aussie flag bat and bar poster, altogether worth $50.90.

The Rockstar bag includes an inflatable guitar, toy trilby and some items including a tinsel hair clip the site lists as worth $395, giving the bag a total retail value of $413.70 for the bargain price of $10.

Bricks are scattered everywhere. This was Susan House’s beloved home after a huge explosion ripped off two of the walls and left the rest of the property on the brink of collapse. Susan House amazingly survived a huge gas explosion that ripped through her farmhouse - because she was out walking her dogs at the time . Fire crews were called after a tremendous blast was heard, blowing the back wall and windows out and causing substantial damage to the roof . Ms House went for a stroll shortly before the detached property exploded yesterday afternoon, leaving a scene of destruction . A bath tub can be seen teetering over the edge of what was once the upstairs bathroom after the explosion, which miraculously injured no one . The 55-year-old’s house may be in ruins but she can count herself extremely lucky to be alive – having left to take her dogs for a walk in the spring sunshine not long before the blast. She returned to find it looking like a bomb site, with rubble strewn across her garden and her belongings left exposed to the elements. The explosion originated in the kitchen, prompting the emergency services to believe that it was caused by a gas leak because the house is supplied by a propane tank. Although there was serious damage to the remaining walls and roof, some of the content of the rooms remained intact. Books were still lined up neatly on shelves in the downstairs office, a painting still hung on a remaining wall and the computer seemed unscathed. What remains of the detached home, called Bleak House, in Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire, will have to be ‘flattened’, according to Miss House’s father. George House, 86, who has owned the property for 53 years and lives on the same street with his wife Hilda, said: ‘My daughter was out walking the dogs at the time. She lives there alone and it was really lucky that she wasn’t there. ‘She is too upset to talk about it. Due to it being bank holiday there is nothing we can do with it at the moment.’ An upstairs bedroom , still with a bed and chest of drawers in tact, is visible from the garden as the wall of the room was completely blown off . Kevin Hinson was in his garden half a mile away when he heard what he described as a 'big bang', but mistook it for a bomb going off .

Firefighters were able to put out a small fire without entering the home in case of any collapse . Wrecked: Pieces of brick, windows and plaster lie scattered across the garden, leaving the interior of the home completely visible . Residents in Theddlethorpe said the explosion was heard across the village. Kevin Hinson was in his garden half a mile away when he heard a ‘big bang’.

              " {'sequence': \"From location tagging to unmonitored comments to blatant sexual harassment, a new video streaming app has all the ingredients to become a parent's latest nightmare. Periscope, Twitter's new iPhone app which allows users to broadcast live video and audio online, launched a week ago today and early adapters have already discovered potentially hair-raising issues with the much talked-about technology, which claims on its website that it is 'the closest thing to teleportation'. Despite the initial hype surrounding the launch of the app, which is being touted as a revolutionary new way to share news, there are already a concerning number of users, particularly women, reporting that they have been sexually harassed, or trolled, while using the technology. Streaming revolution: Periscope, an iPhone app that allows users to broadcast live video and audio to the internet, launched last Thursday . Warning: App developer Justin Esgar is warning parents about the app's various 'land mines' and insists that they need to monitor their child's use of it (stock image) Justin Esgar, App Developer of the app Goodnight, told Daily Mail Online that because Periscope 'allows users to share even more of their intimate lives with each other than ever before', there are 'apparent dangers' that users have to consider before accessing it. Emma Barker, sex and relationships editor at\\xa0Cosmopolitan.com, noted that the app is already crawling with men who are using the anonymity afforded to them by the app's settings in order to sexually harass women - including one of her female friends. She explained that her friend recently tried out the app by sharing a conversation she was having with her female roommate. They were fully clothed, sitting on a couch and casually conversing, yet 'within the first 20 seconds the first comment popped up’, asking for the women to ‘show butt’. While neither of them were speaking in an even remotely sexual manor, the lude comments continued to pour in and included phrases such as: 'Show boobs', 'Age?' and 'I would soooo swipe right on both [sic]!' One particularly creepy user asked: 'Do you get out of the shower to pee?' According to Periscope's community guidelines, the app prohibits 'pornographic or overtly sexual content' as well as 'explicitly graphic content or media that is intended to incite violent, illegal or dangerous activities'. And while a spokesperson for the app told Emma that Periscope has a team dedicated to content review, there doesn't appear to be anything specific being done to prevent sexual commentary and online harassment. The app's policies are, unsurprisingly, similar to Twitter, which is currently testing out a 'quality filter' that monitors and removes threats and offensive language out of users notifications feeds. It's not clear as to whether or not Periscope will be given a similar screening system. But the recent reports of harassment and bullying have sparked concern among parents of many of the children and teenagers who currently have access to the app – raising questions about whether it is truly safe for young people to be using it, given that they could potentially be opening themselves up to all manner of abuse, be it of a violent, or sexual, nature. Another startling revelation about the app, was revealed by Fast Company\\xa0editor Rose Pastore, who was testing out the app and learned that it had a major privacy flaw. According to Rose, if users neglected to turn off the location sharing feature, their video streams would be accompanied by a 'zoomable' map which allowed others to pinpoint their exact locations down to the intersection. Thankfully, Periscope disabled the zooming feature on the map as a part of its first system update, but the app still enables locations. Special features: The app, which is owned by Twitter, allows users to follow certain people (L) and scroll through a 'Watch' feed of live videos (R) Mr Esgar noted: 'Periscope requires not only your camera and microphone, but access to your location [if you want to broadcast video]. This means not only are you sharing your video, you are letting other users know where you are.' He added: 'That means your children potentially being found by, best case, a disgruntled ex-spouse. The worst case clearly presents even higher levels of danger. You can easily search for users of the app, even if their Tweet streams are privatized.' Periscope does enable users to hide their location once they begin broadcasting - but many users admit they didn't think to disable the feature before starting their video stream. While testing the app, Mr Esgar said he watched\\xa0Kevin Jonas and his daughter ride bicycles, a German man drinking, comedian Jim Gaffigan getting his hair washed and an office learning about Periscope. 'I don’t know or follow any of these people on Twitter but there it was, all live for me to watch on my train ride home,' he said. And while Periscope has provided guidelines for content, Mr Esgar noted that there doesn't seem to be any 'curation on the app either' - essentially allowing users to show whatever they want. Users can report them, or even block, any people that they do not wish to be able to see their videos, and can also hide any or all chats any time by swiping right, scrolling to the bottom of the list of viewers and selecting 'hide chat'. But by then it may already too late. You can't unsee something you have already seen, especially if you are an impressionable child. 'We’ve all heard stories of people sending nude photos to one another either via text or other social media apps,' Mr Esgar explained. 'Now you can easily stream nude videos. Clearly, this opens a lot of potential land mines for parents to now have to try and control.' One user's labeled his Periscope live stream video: 'I'm brabroadcastingom my hotel room in LA. What could be more exciting than that? Stop by and say hello?' Another touted a live video of a 'Crazy party in London'. And then there is the issue of children and teens falling prey to online bullying. Mr Esgar said that he 'witnessed a tireless stream of anonymous people saying things that would be inappropriate for a younger audience. The dangers of online bullying are huge, and Periscope, while a great app when used responsibly, allows bullying to escalate exponentially.' He said the app should alter its features to include stronger privacy options, the ability to block location services, curation of commentary, as well as the addition of parental controls. 'Periscope’s concept is great - live streaming made easy,' he said, before adding: 'But maybe it’s just too easy?'\",\n",

Shigella infections, otherwise known as 'Delhi Belly' or 'Montezuma's revenge' were traced to people who had recently traveled to the Dominican Republic, India or other countries. The symptoms include diarrhea, stomach cramps and nausea. Outbreaks of the Shigella bacteria are not unusual, but this strain is resistant to the antibiotic most commonly prescribed for adults. Cases of shigellosis (bacteria pictured), otherwise known as 'Delhi Belly' or 'Montezuma's revenge' were traced to people who had recently traveled to the Dominican Republic, India or other countries . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the report Thursday. The superbug sickened at least 243 people, in 32 states and Puerto Rico. Sometimes antibiotics are prescribed, especially for more serious cases. CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a statement: 'These outbreaks show a troubling trend in Shigella infections in the United States. 'Drug-resistant infections are harder to treat and because Shigella spreads so easily between people, the potential for more – and larger – outbreaks is a real concern. 'We’re moving quickly to implement a national strategy to curb antibiotic resistance because we can’t take for granted that we’ll always have the drugs we need to fight common infections. Scientists  unlocked the genetic code of bacteria grown from a soldier who died of dysentery in World War I. Their findings revealed a superbug already resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics decades before they were in common use. CDC Director Tom Frieden said the spike in outbreaks show a 'troubling trend' in Shigella infections across the United States . Kate Baker of Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute said last November\\xa0that analysis of genetic differences between this 1915 sample of Shigella flexneri and three others isolated in 1954, 1984 and 2002 showed that while the bacterium has changed relatively little, the mutations it has acquired have made it more dangerous and persistent. It also went though what is known as a 'serotype conversion', she said, which made it able to re-infect and cause illness in people who had already been infected before and would previously have been immune to further attacks. Shigella causes an estimated 500,000 cases of diarrhea in the United States every year. CDC and public health partners investigated several recent clusters of shigellosis in Massachusetts, California and Pennsylvania and found that nearly 90 percent of the cases tested were resistant to ciprofloxacin (Cipro), the first choice to treat shigellosis among adults in the United States.\",\n",

The Scandfit\\xa0Try Size — dubbed ‘the boob-job bra’ — was developed to help women about to go under the knife decide what size implants to have. Not surprisingly, it has gained a following among women like me who would never have surgery but love the idea of trying out a dream decolletage for a day. Scroll down for video . At a size 34B, Annabel Cole (pictured without the bra) \\xa0has long dreamed of having a bigger bust but would never have surgery, so she decided to put 'the boob-job bra' through its paces . I decided to put the design through its paces in three variations — a C cup, D cup and whopping DD! Starting with the smallest first, this is what I found . . . FROM B-CUP TO C-CUP, BUT IT'S TOO SAGGY . Cleavage you can change like your clothes? Yes, please! I’m terribly excited by the idea of the Try Size — even more so when it arrives packaged in a white leather box. Soft, black and lace-trimmed, it comes with four pairs of inserts labelled one to four, according to their size. The inserts are measured in cubic centimetres, like surgical implants. The lightest, size one, weighs in at 50cc, followed by size two at 100cc, size three at 200cc and size four at 300cc. One added cup size is roughly equivalent to 200cc, and the idea is that the inserts can be layered in various combinations to create different sizes of cleavage. The Scandfit Try Size (pictured) has been dubbed\\xa0‘the boob-job bra’ and\\xa0comes with four pairs of inserts which can be layered to create different sizes of cleavage . While the Try Size is pretty, it is also hefty. Out of curiosity I plonk it on my kitchen scales: the whole package weighs well over a kilo. I had assumed that the inserts would be silicone, but these are filled with rice and resemble silky bean bags. Apparently, rice is about the same weight by volume as surgical implants and can be moulded more realistically to your breast shape. Each bra cup has an internal pocket to hold the inserts. Annabel is seen here wearing the\\xa0size three 200cc insert which takes her modest B cup to a C cup, she says she was sorely disappointed with the results of the rice filled insert on this occasion . I start cautiously with the size three 200cc insert, taking my modest B cup to a comelier C. The inserts prove easy to put in but the first hurdle comes with doing up the bra. Unlike those I usually wear, this has four rows of hooks — presumably to cope with the maximum potential weight — and it takes me a few extra minutes to get them fully done up. Once the bra is on, I feel let down. I’d been expecting some kind of ‘Hello Boys’ perky bosom but I’m sorely disappointed. What I get is more like a real-life middle-aged C cup — ever so slightly droopy and a little lopsided. But I persist and push around the rice, patting and smoothing until it creates a soft, rounded shape. I decide to try out my new look on my harshest critics — my children. I throw on a tight T-shirt and wander into the kitchen. As I load the dishwasher, 12-year-old Rosa peers at me and pipes up: ‘Your boobs look weird. What have you done?’ I come clean and explain. It doesn’t go well. Elsa, 15, snorts: ‘That’s pathetic!’ I try to explain that the bra simulates ‘real cleavage’ and that I am going to be trying out various looks. ‘Don’t bother,’ she snaps. ‘It makes you look fat.’ Ouch! CONFIDENT AND SEXY WITH \\xa0D-CUP . I decide to try my next look on a different audience. Reasoning that my closest friend Nancy is bound to be more supportive, I stuff my bra with the size three and size two inserts — 300cc in total — to give me a much-increased D cup. We’ve booked for lunch at a restaurant, but the problems start before I leave the house. What should I wear? I try on a succession of tunic tops and soft blouses. With a B-cup they look pretty and feminine, but now they are too short and the fabric hangs down from the shelf created by my new boobs. To my horror, I look decidedly fat. Annabel is seen here wearing the inserts that increase her bust size to 34D, although initially self-conscious of her significant cleavage, she was startled by how natural it made her boobs look . I resort to a clinging V-neck dress — a once-worn look-at-me frock bought for a wedding. It’s not what I’d normally wear, but I’m not dressing for myself now; I am dressing for my cleavage — and it’s certainly eye-catching. Nancy is terribly complimentary and I feel rather bouyed up, but as we sit down I feel the disapproving gaze of a couple of mums I recognise, who are lunching near by. Do I look desperate? At 43, am I too old to show off my cleavage? I feel self-conscious, but I press on. My husband and I have tickets to a West End show in the evening, so to ensure maximum impact I invest in an expensive low-cut dress on the basis that if I have ‘it’ (even temporarily) I might as well flaunt it. I am startled to see a new me in the mirror. The boobs look natural, not the typical half-moon shape that screams ‘boob job’, and I feel confident and sexier than usual. It works. My husband, not usually known for his ability to notice a new haircut, outfit or even one of his own children at a distance, cottons on instantly and compliments me in his own special way. ‘You have a figure at last! Does it go bigger?’ GETTING BACKACHE WITH DOUBLE Ds . Next, I try out the boob-job bra at the supermarket — and for this one, I decide to go all-in. With some trepidation I insert size four, size three and size two — 600cc in total. Instantly, I am three cup sizes bigger than I’ve ever been. My posture changes at once: I am pulled forward by the extra weight, leaving me hunched over and exposing a vast swathe of cleavage to my fellow shoppers. Pushing the trolley is even harder work than usual, and I now understand why women with large breasts complain of backache. My bust is enormous and looks wildly out of proportion with my 5ft 4in, size 8 frame. Even walking at a stately pace, my chest jiggles alarmingly. I bend down to pick a box of cereal off the bottom shelf and worry that I’m about to suffer a wardrobe malfunction. Finally, Annabel tested out the\\xa0600cc inserts that increased her bust size to a 34E cup. Annabel says she felt her bust became wildly out of proportion to her body as she is only\\xa05ft 4in and a size 8 . I can’t ever imagine running for a bus with a bust like this. Things are no easier at home. I crouch down to sweep the floor and my chest hits my knees; I sit down for a snack and my bust slams on the table before the plate. And sleeping? As I lie down, my boobs separate and sag to the sides alarmingly. I toss and turn but can’t get comfortable. I usually sleep on my side, but then my chest feels squashed. It’s even worse on my front. I try to snuggle up to my husband but once again my DDs are in the way, though to judge by his reaction he doesn’t mind too much. Finally, I remove two of the inserts and drop off flat on my back. The next day, I slip back into my normal 34B bra with great relief. While I’ll be bringing out the D cup on a special occasion — my husband’s birthday, for example — the stop-the-traffic cleavage is far too much for me.\",\n",

The Florida court heard  how Bryan Santana was living out some kind of sick fantasy when he removed all the lightbulbs of the Orlando home he shared with Shelby Fazio, 23, before waiting for the young woman to return, killing her and then abusing her body in October last year. Jurors were told Santana first choked Fazio in a headlock before wrapping a belt around her neck and stabbing her with a hunting knife. He then killed and mutilated her dog, and wrote messages in blood on the wall, including: ''I'm not sorry for what I did.' The panel took just two hours to deliberate on Thursday, and Fazio's family cried in their seats as the verdict was handed down. Maniac:\\xa0Bryan Santana, 20, of Orlando, Florida, was found guilty of the the cold-blooded murder of his roommate, Shelby Fazio, 23, on Thursday. He was sentenced to life terms in prison . In court: The trial in Orlando lasted just three days, with Santana previously admitted to murdering the victim and raping her corpse, with the jury deliberating for two hours . Overcome: Family members of the victim, Shelby Fazio, weep as her killer is found guilty on Thursday . 'This is endless': Afterwards the family said they will 'never escape' the death of the young woman, who was murdered by her roommate, Bryan Santana . 'You will not be remembered. Oh but Shelby will':\\xa0Judge Renee Roche was scathing in her closing statements, saying Santana 'no glimmer of humanity' Judge Renee Roche said Santana has 'no glimmer of humanity', according to WFTV. 'You will not be remembered. Oh but Shelby will,' Judge Roche said. 'Even her beloved dog will be remembered longer than the defendant.' Cindy Fazio, the victim's mother, said they will never properly deal with her death. 'No more pleasures in life. Each day is just another we don't have with Shelby. No more good days, only days we get through,' said Fazio's mother, Cindy Fazio. She called Santana a 'violent coward.' The victim's father, Terry Fazio, added: 'This is endless. We'll never escape. Hope you get it as bad as you did to Shelby.' Roche gave Santana two life sentences for the murder of Fazio and attempted murder of his second roommate. He was also found guilty of cruelty to animals, abuse of a dead human body and two counts of grand theft. Bryan Santana (left) of Orlando, Florida murdered his roommate Shelby Fazio (right) in October and sexually abused her dead body. He then killed her dog, stole their other roommates car, and went to get a haircut . Santana was also charged with attempted murder for allegedly attacking their third roommate with a knife and killing Fazio's dog (above), and using its blood to write messages on the wall . Prosecutors said Santana 'delighted' in the pain he allegedly caused the young woman. 'He delights in every moment of telling explicitly what he had done to Shelby,' Assistant State Attorney Mark Interlicchio told jurors during opening statements on Wednesday. The\\xa0Orlando Sentinel\\xa0reported Santana even messaged a friend and forewarned what was to come, claiming he was going to 'gut' someone, and then saying; 'I have zero money to pay my $400 rent so I'm going to do what I want. I will fulfill my deepest desires.' Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Charlie Murphy took to the stand on Wednesday, describing the grizzly scene he discovered when he arrived at the residence Fazio and Santana shared. 'I noticed a body laying on the ground, the door hit the left leg of the body,' he said. 'She was naked. I remember she had a belt around her throat and some type of pen or pencil shoved into her neck.' This came just days after Santana's lawyer argued that he is not competent to stand trial following an incident where he smeared feces all over himself and tried to hit a corrections officer at the courthouse during opening statements in the case. 'He has now soiled himself and smeared himself in feces and smeared the wall,' said Judge Renee Roche after the incident, according to\\xa0WKMG. 'I've ordered security to clean him up and bring him up here in full restraints.' And while she allowed two doctors to examine the young man, she has made it clear that she has no time for this\\xa0behavior. 'He certainly knows how to behave himself in the courtroom. He behaved himself very well yesterday. Now that the train is coming down the tracks at full speed, we are seeing some other behavior,' she said. 'I will not tolerate disruption in this courtroom. If I have to gag him, I will. If I have to remove him I will.' In earlier court documents, Santana confessed to the\\xa0strangling, stabbing and sexual intercourse. He also claimed he has multiple personalities, including one named 'Michael.' In court documents, Santana (right) admitted to strangling and stabbing Fazio (left), a Disney World employee, to death, and then having sex with her corpse . Fazio, 23, had moved in with the young man to begin a job at Disney World. The two had a third roommate who Santana also allegedly tried to kill. That roommate claims Santana pepper sprayed him and came at him with a knife. 'He came at me, pepper sprayed me, I tried to knock the knife out of his hand and was successful in doing that,' said John Heermance. 'And then we wrestled in the living room area.' Heermance then testified on Wednesday that at this point Santana told him to go into his room and everything would be fine. After the incident, Santana is believed to have taken Fazio's car and tried to go to a Walmart to buy a toy gun in hopes that he would be shot dead if he pointed it at police, a jury heard. He also went and got a haircut. Friends say the young man no longer wanted to live. Laura Ramirez, a friend of Santana, said on the stand: 'He just said he was going to fulfill his fantasies.' She then added: 'He said he was going to gut her.'\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Some find them unnerving and even slightly creepy while, to others, they are endearing, mysterious and charming. Whatever your view, one thing’s for certain: when it comes to twins, particularly identical ones, they are an endless source of fascination. Yet, despite all this interest, the rest of us remain baffled, emotionally and scientifically, by the uncanny bonds identical twins share. Having spent a year researching twins for my new novel, I have come to realise that we are only beginning to grasp how strange they truly are and quite why they have compelled us for thousands of years. Ashley (left) and Mary-Kate Olsen (right) are two of the most famous twins in the world and despite their very similar appearances they are not actually identical twins . Take pre-colonial Brazilians, who thought twins were a product of adultery, resulting in the poor innocent mother often being executed for her supposed infidelity. Some primitive African societies abhorred twins because of the way multiple births resemble an animal’s litter. It wasn’t uncommon for the unlucky children to be slaughtered and their mother exiled. In Greek mythology, however, twins were believed to be the product of human intercourse with the gods, meaning they were sacred, while ancient Slavs maintained that twins shared one special soul. Not all monozygotic twins (i.e. twins born from a single fertilised egg) are truly identical. Some are ‘mirror image’ twins. This means that in one twin the hair might swirl clockwise, in the other twin it will swirl anticlockwise — but it will swirl in exactly the same way. For one twin, the left side of the mouth might curve upwards; in the other twin, the right side of the mouth has precisely the same curve. This peculiar ‘looking-glass effect’ extends to the positioning of internal organs. But many identicals are truly identical in ways we are still uncovering. Obviously, identical twins share facial characteristics and body shape. But they also share virtually identical DNA, meaning they are more closely related to each other than to anyone else, including their parents or their own children. Joel (left) and Benji Madden (right) are identical twins, it's likely that they will have grown more alike over time as their identical DNA asserts itself . A daring £5 million jewel heist was carried out at a Berlin department store in 2009. Closed-circuit TV showed one of three masked man removing a glove at the scene, which the police later recovered. The glove provided DNA evidence traced to identical twin brothers. But with no way of pinning it on one brother, both were acquitted. Identicals also share the same blood group, the same hormones, the same serum proteins; they are alike in heart rate, blood pressure, brain waves, respiratory rate and digestive process. Hospitals in America in the past have advised parents to discreetly tattoo one twin — with a tiny dot, or mark on a heel — so that in future the children can be differentiated. Parents often refuse, believing they will be able to distinguish their twins as they age (not least, by dressing them differently). This, however, can be a mistake because twins can grow more identical over time (as their identical DNA asserts itself, following different levels of nourishment in the womb). And twins often end up being dressed in exactly the same clothes anyway, lest one become jealous of the other getting ‘better’ treatment. Here, we enter the peculiar world of twin psychology. Over recent decades, scientists such as Thomas Bouchard, of the Minnesota Centre For Twin And Family Research, have analysed the personalities of twins and discovered seriously uncanny facts. Take the classic example of twins separated at birth. The extent to which they can echo each other in later life is breathtaking. One of my favourite cases is the separated twins who discovered, when reunited, that they both entered the sea on beach holidays by wading backwards up to their knees. Probably the most famous case of eerie identicality is that of Jim Lewis and Jim Springer. These identical American twins were separated when four weeks old, and adopted by different families in Ohio. When reunited at the age of 39, in 1979, they discovered that both of them suffered from tension headaches, both had worked as sheriff’s deputies and both smoked Salem cigarettes. Hunter (left) and Scarlett Johansson (right) are fraternal twins and so do not share the same strong characteristics and traits as identical twins do . They also drove exactly the same kind of car and both enjoyed woodworking in the garage. Both had been named James by their respective adoptive parents, and both had married twice — first to women named Linda, then to women called Betty. Both had produced sons named James Allan. Both had at one time owned dogs named Toy. And they both took their holidays at the very same beach in Florida. Some parents of twins have reported their children having identical dreams. Others recount twins suffering pains, in the same part of the body, when only one of them is hurt. Doctors who observe twins in the womb have watched identicals do a strange kind of matching twin dance: the fetal twins come close to each other, face to face, then one of the twins makes a circle, and the other does the very same. It as if they are, in utero, telepathically aware of each other’s movements. Even in death, twins share an incredible bond. A prime, if rather dark, example is the 72‑year‑old brothers in Finland. In 2002, they were killed on their bicycles on the same road in Northern Finland in two accidents, two hours apart. When one twin survives the death of another, they likewise possess an oddness which startles. Author Joan Woodward, in her 2009 study of twin bereavement, reported several striking examples of twins’ reactions when one of them dies. Some young twins simply do not believe the death, and continue to act as if the lost twin is alive, talking to the dead sibling at breakfast, in a shared twin language, for instance. John and Edward Grimes, commonly known as 'Jedward', are identical twins. Some parents of identical twins have observed them having identical dreams or even suffering pain in the same parts of the body . Other infant twins seem painfully confused as to whether their twin is really gone, because they keep seeing the living image of their dead sibling in the mirror or in a reflecting window; when they see themselves, they see the sibling. By contrast, a few bereaved twin children deliberately seek out mirrors in order to reassure themselves their dead twin lives on. They want to see the living ghost. Other twins react differently still. Woodward records how some, following the death of a co-twin, take over their lost sibling’s characteristics and behaviour, as if trying to make up for the loss by actually becoming the dead sibling. One twin whose brother died at the age of 12 became so eerily like his dead sibling that his parents were convinced he had the ‘spirit of his brother within him’. Another female twin was so grief-stricken she took her dead sister’s name. These strange reactions surrounding the deaths of identicals can have effects beyond the twins themselves. During my research, I came across one wholly remarkable example of twin confusion, following a death. It happened in California in the Nineties (though the details and names have been protected by the authorities, for obvious reasons). One day, driving off on holiday, the Andersons — father, mother and their identical twin daughters Samantha and Katie — had a terrible crash. An ambulance was called and the victims were cut from the car. However, after reaching the hospital, Samantha soon died and Katie was left in a coma. It was a horrific loss, but life had to go on. The family concentrated on helping the hospitalised Samantha get over the death of her twin. A funeral for Katie was held. And yet, as her surviving daughter improved, mum Sally found it strange that Samantha behaved so much like her dead sister. Finally, Sally studied her child’s birthmark very closely (the twins had similar but not identical birthmarks) and realised a terrible mistake had been made — Katie had survived and Samantha had died. This realisation occurred two weeks after the accident. The Andersons had buried the ‘wrong’ daughter. It was reading that extraordinary true-life story — and all these other facts — that gave me the idea for a thriller. What would happen if the Andersons’ experience was repeated, but the family only discovered their error a year later? What ghostly consequences might ensue? Whatever the answer, one thing I know for sure is that twins will continue to fascinate us because they pose so many profound and unsettling questions. S. K.

              " {'sequence': \"Michael Bloomberg wants to be mayor again - but in London rather than New York City, according to reports. Bloomberg, who was elected to the top Big Apple job three times in a row, has reportedly turned his sights across the Atlantic, where he dreams of replacing incumbent Boris Johnson. According to Britain's Sunday Times, Bloomberg, 73, is 'considering' the move, and has the backing of senior officials in Britain's Conservative Party. Scroll down for video . Passing the torch? Michael Bloomberg, right, is pictured above with London mayor Boris Johnson. He is reportedly considering standing for Johnson's job in 2016 . Bloomberg has significant business interests in the city. His Bloomberg financial information company has offices there, while he personally owns a $30million mansion. In the past he has described London as his 'second home'. His ex-wife is a British citizen, as are his two daughters. Though Bloomberg holds U.S. citizenship, sources told the Sunday Times that officials could arrange for a switch to make him eligible for high office. London is due a new mayor in 2016. Boris Johnson, who was himself born in New York City, will then have held the position for eight years. 'Job swap': Johnson, right, who is seen as a future Prime Minister, once joked about swapping jobs with Bloomberg, left, who has said he thinks of London as a 'second home' If Michael Bloomberg does become Mayor of London, it would be the latest twist in a long career which has seen him rise to the top in both business and politics. He started his career as an investment banker with Salomon Brothers, and when he was laid off from the firm in 1981 he used his $10million payout to start his own financial information company, Bloomberg LP. The firm is best known for the 'Bloomberg terminals' which provide real-time updates on the financial markets and are now ubiquitous on banks' trading floors. Bloomberg has also spawned an network of news outlets including a cable TV station, financial news website and the magazine Businessweek. In 2001, Mr Bloomberg entered politics by running as the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, and spent $73million of his own money getting elected. He went on to serve 12 years as mayor, drawing praise for his businesslike management of city government, but he courted controversy with high-profile decisions such as banning smoking indoors and outlawing extra-large sodas. Despite his repeated electoral success, Mr Bloomberg has faced opposition from the Left over his close links to Wall Street, while the Right has reacted with anger against his campaign to impose new restrictions on gun ownership across the US. Johnson is also standing for a seat in Britain's parliament in the country's May elections. He has said if he wins he will stay in the mayor's job until 2016, while serving as MP for the London constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the same time. He has long been spoken of as a future Prime Minister, and was recently named by incumbent David Cameron as a potential successor. Johnson has spoken before of the advantages of a new mayor coming in, though he could technically run for a third term. Speaking in 2013 to London radio station LBC, he said: 'The reality is that after eight years you've been at it for a long time in a very big job. 'You see what happens to people who do things for too long. You've got to be fair to the electorate, you've got to be sure you are doing your best. 'There will come people who will have fantastic ideas and who will have fresh ways of thinking about things.' Bloomberg and Johnson have met before - and at one meeting in 2013, Johnson even joked about doing a 'job swap' with Bloomberg - though there is no suggestion Johnson has set his sights on New York City. A source close to Johnson told the Sunday Times: 'Mike is an enormous friend of London. He’s a great contributor to the city. He’s got many supporters and admirers of which Boris is definitely one.' If indeed Bloomberg decided on an unlkely run for mayor, he would have to jump through some hoops. As an American citizen he would have to apply for British residency. This process is lengthy but can be speeded up if the person invested $15 million into the country. This would present no difficulties for Bloomberg who is the 13th richest man in the world, worth $36 billion. Ineed, both of Bloomberg's daughter's are British and his ex-wife is Susan Brown, is from the north of England.\",\n",

A jilted lover who sent explicit revenge porn images of his ex-partner to her daughter and set up 67 Facebook profiles to bombard her with abuse has been jailed. Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with abusive messages over the internet after she tried to end their relationship in October last year. A court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on to her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that\\xa0the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant,\\xa0saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she\\xa0'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. She said: 'He started setting up different profiles on Facebook to send me messages. He also sent my family messages and my friends messages because he couldn't get to me. 'I was very upset, it drove me insane, it made me depressed. I'm on medication. 'His language was absolutely disgusting. He was asking me why I wasn't playing any more, calling me names.' The victim said Cotterill found pictures of her on the internet that he threatened to send to her family and friends. He sent more than one to her daughter, she said. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes . In October last year, Cotterill sent the victim a link to an x-rated explicit video with a message that said: 'F**k it, I'm going to have it as my profile picture'. He also taunted the victim on Facebook, telling her: 'I am going to send some more pictures too because it's fun lol.' The 42-year-old was 'driven insane' and suffered depression and panic attacks after Cotterill spent a year sending 'disgusting' messages. David Houldcroft, defending, said Cotterill, who had two previous\\xa0convictions for harassment, accepted sending the link and that it would have caused her upset. Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim . 'He regrets that and understands that he has problems with relationships,' Mr Houldcroft said.

Beheluli stashed £24,000 in his bank account and told officers it was gambling winnings from the World Cup. Officers found betting slips showing he had recently placed £12,000 stakes at Ladbrokes and William Hill. National Crime Agency branch commander Oliver Higgins said: 'Beheluli seemed to enjoy the high life and gambling with the money he made from drug dealing, but in the end his luck run out. 'These men were involved in supplying significant quantities of high-purity class A drugs, as demonstrated by the value of the cash, cocaine and heroin we have seized from them. Haul: The 24-year-old, who was jailed for 11 years, posted a picture of himself with £250,000 on Twitter . Officers said that\\xa0Beheluli appeared to 'enjoy the high life' with the money he made from drug dealing . Haul: More than £4million of cocaine and heroin (pictured) was found when police searched the 'stash house' 'But they were unaware that they were being watched by the NCA, and their arrest and subsequent conviction should have the wider criminal fraternity looking over their shoulders.' Beheluli was found guilty of conspiring to supply Class A drugs and was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment on Wednesday. Albanians Proshka and Topalli will be deported after they serve ten years in prison after admitting conspiring to supply drugs, money laundering and possessing fake ID documents. Behelui was jailed alongside Besim Topalli, 29, left, and Azem Proshka, 23, right, for a total of 31 years .\",\n",

Wearing a blonde wig and a pink jacket, Carson took on the role of Olivia Newton-John’s character Sandy, while Savannah, in a leather jacket and sunglasses, was Danny, originally played by John Travolta. The duo went head to head with Al Roker, Willie Geist and Natalie Morales, who also donned long blonde wigs for their cover of Australian singer Sia’s Chandelier. The two teams were judged by TV star and model Chrissy Teigen, one of the hosts of Spike TV’s new series Lip Sync Battle, which premieres tonight, and was the inspiration for the Today hosts’ colorful performances. Face-off: Al Roker, Natalie Morales and Willie Geist went head to head with Savannah Guthrie and Carson Daly during the Today show's first ever lip sync battle, which was judged by Chrissy Teigen . Nice touch: Savannah and Carson reversed gender roles and dressed as Danny and Sandy, respectively, from Grease . While Savannah and Carson switched gender roles and performed Summer Nights and Al, Natalie and Willie showcased their dancing skills for Chandelier, their co-host Matt Lauer somehow managed to avoid getting caught up in the battle altogether – something which Chrissy was more than happy to highlight.. When Matt announced Savannah and Carson to the stage in front of the live audience outside the show's Rockefeller studio, Chrissy couldn't help but ask: 'How did you get out of this?' 'Because I'm with you,' Matt joked.' In order to truly embrace the role of Danny, Savannah wore an oversized leather motorcycle jacket and her hair slicked back. Meanwhile, her partner Carson sported a blonde wig and a Pink Ladies bomber jacket to play Sandy. Good try: The two gave it their all as they lip synced a rendition of the class song from the film Summer Nights . Great props: Savannah wore a leather motorcycle jacket while Carson sported a Pink Ladies bomber jacket and a blonde wig . After their spirited performance of Summer Nights, Matt laughed and said: 'Don't worry. We will never show this tape again.' But even dressed as members of the opposite sex, Savannah and Carson were no match for their competition. When Al, Willie and Natalie took their turn on stage, Matt joked that Al looked 'remarkably like something out of Wayne's World' with his white wig. 'I am actually Cousin Itt,' he responded. While Willie did his best silent Sia performance, Al and Natalie flailed their bodies across the stage, in an attempt to mirror the music video’s 12-year-old star Maddie Ziegler. Imitation game: Al, Willie and Natalie donned white wigs for their performance of Sia's Chandelier . Feeling confident: Al, Willie and Natalie struck a pose as they waited for the music to start . Great performance: Willie did his best impression of Sia as he lip synced the lyrics to her hit song Chandelier . The crow erupted with applause as soon as they were finished, but Matt couldn't help but note: 'I'm humiliated for you.' Matt explained that for Today's first - and probably last - lip sync battle, the crowd would assist Chrissy in choosing the winner by a show of applause. And Savannah looked visibly irked when it became clear that Al, Willie and Natalie's performance was the audience favorite. 'I think I have to agree with the crowd,' Chrissy said. 'I'm going Team Sia.' Major moves: While Willie pretended to sing, Al and Natalie danced wildly on stage like the 12-year-old star of the Chandelier video, Maddie Ziegler . Synced up: The trio's choreography was spot on throughout their performance . After she presented them with a wrestling belt in honor of their win, Al said: 'This is so fantastic,’ before adding: 'I know Jimmy Fallon is rethinking this whole idea.' Today show fans can also look forward to Willie and his colleague Hoda Kotb duking it out in upcoming episodes of Lip Sync Battle. 'They did a really shockingly good job,' Chrissy told Matt of Willie and Hoda's performances. 'Hoda gave it her all.' In addition to the Today show stars, Dwayne Johnson, Anna Kendrick, Jennifer Lopez, John Legend, John Krasinski, Meghan Trainor, Common and Justin Bieber are all slated flaunt their lip syncing skill on the show's first season . Today show champs: Chrissy named Team Sia the winners of the lip sync battle and awarded them with a wrestling belt, which Al threw over his shoulder . Victorious: Natalie shook hands with Savannah after her team won the 'non-singing' competition .\",\n",

Standing just a few feet apart, the beachfront homes are virtually identical in every way, boasting an indoor swimming pool, four storeys and stunning sea views. But the prospective buyers might have to flip a coin to see who gets which one - because one of the homes comes with an extra en-suite bedroom. Scroll down for video . Two adjoining 'his and hers' mansions have gone on the market on the world-renowned Sandbanks peninsula for £13 million . Tom Doyle, of estate agents Lloyds Property Group which is selling both properties, said the homes would be perfect for a couple who like their independence. He said: 'It would be nice to sell them as a pair, to someone who either wants to live in one and rent out the other or even to a couple who want their own his and her homes.' The beachfront properties called la Plage and la Baie - translated as the beach and the bay - are the latest in the so-called Millionaires' Row in Poole, Dorset, to go on the market. The homes have been built on a 3,000sqm plot, which was previously occupied by a  four-bedroom house. But after buying the plot for £4.25m, developers eked out every square on the area by building two homes - a move which has trebled the value of the plot. Boasting a prime position on the south east corner of the millionaire's enclave, the mansions can be bought as a pair or separately. Standing just a few feet apart, the beachfront homes are virtually identical in every way, boasting an indoor swimming pool, four storeys and stunning sea views . The beachfront properties called la Plage and la Baie - which mean the beach and the bay - are the latest in the so-called Millionaires' Row to go on the market and boast these incredible sea views (pictured) They occupy a prime position on the south east corner of the millionaire's enclave in Poole, Dorset (pictured) While one of the homes has five en-suite bedrooms, the other has four. But both have indoor swimming pools, balconies, lifts to all floors, direct beach access and magnificent sea views. It is thought the developers have spent more than £3m building the two homes. Mr Doyle said that, if bought separately, the properties would each be sold for £6.5m - the same as the price of a 38-bed castle in the Scottish Highlands . He said: 'Development opportunities are becoming scarcer on Sandbanks and so prices for older houses are going up. 'Developers need to maximise the space available in order to make money. It is becoming harder to financially justify building one home on a plot and so we are now seeing two homes appear. The agent marketing the homes said more developers are building multiple homes on a single plot to get better value for money in the area (pictured), which is the most expensive place to buy in the UK . Over the last two decades Sandbanks has become a millionaire's playground with dozens of luxury beachfront mansions being built and sold for up to £12 million . 'Although a lot of the plots are quite deep you can't spread out or go beyond the existing building line so you have build upwards as much as the planning authorities will allow.' He added: 'Both these properties are built over four levels, with the bedrooms on the upper two floors. They are very much high end in terms of their quality. 'I can also see them appealing to middle-age professionals who want them as a second home.' Last year, two properties called Tom and Jerry went on the market in Sandbanks after being built on one plot, just 10inches apart. It paved the way for more developers to follow the trend. Over the last two decades Sandbanks has become a millionaire's playground with dozens of luxury beachfront mansions being built and sold for up to £12 million. Last year, two properties called Tom and Jerry went on the market in Sandbanks after being built on the same plot, just 10inches apart (pictured) The two homes were built on a one acre site once occupied by a single bungalow (pictured) Sandbanks is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind London, Manhattan and Tokyo - to buy property. Prices in the area have soared in the past few years, with prospective buyers even able to get more for their money in the exclusive London neighbourhood of Mayfair. In 2013, one property on Sandbanks sold for the equivalent of £1,725  per square foot, which is a record for the area. Sandbanks, though, is not a haunt of A-list actresses or pop stars - but more of football managers, including former Queen's Park Rangers boss Harry Redknapp. The football manager bought his ultra-modern property with his wife Sandra for £3million in 2001 and commuted daily from his waterfront home to QPR's London-based ground Loftus Road. Troubled footballer Paul Gascoigne also reportedly moved to the exclusive resort, where he is said to be renting a flash penthouse apartment. Other notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, and Mr Redknapp's son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden also has a home there. There are also a smattering of businessmen, most of whom are newly retired and unsure what to do with all their money. Located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of property. By area Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs, nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach', boasts the fourth highest land value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive properties outside London. Sandbanks' popularity is attributed to its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel. Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions. The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand. In July 2009 a 1,393-square-metre (14,990 sq ft) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5 million – the equivalent of nearly £10,000 per square metre. And last year, a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth £5million - a 500,000 per cent increase in value. A a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country also went on sale last year for an eye-watering £2.25million. In Novembe, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £6.25m - double what it was worth when there was a house on the site. Notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie.

Miss Campbell said: ‘I was just so desperately ill that the relationship was put under extreme pressure.’ But the split was amicable, with Miss Campbell and Mr McMorrow, 32, a marketing consultant, making Lexi-River their priority. Miss Campbell suffered horrific injuries when a mortar bomb hit the building in Basra she was guarding while serving with 19 Tank Transporter Squadron in 2007 as a young mum with a then three-year-old daughter, Milly, from a previous relationship. She has since split from long-term partner\\xa0Anthony McMorrow (left). She was\\xa0serving with 19 Tank Transporter Squadron (right) in 2007 when the blast happened . The couple, pictured with Hannah's daughter Milly and Anthony's son Leo, have decided to split after Hannah began suffering from a mystery condition . She was blinded in one eye, her left hand was split in two and her left leg was shattered. Shrapnel damaged her abdomen, leading doctors to tell her she’d never be able to have another child. Two years after the blast she elected to have her leg amputated, as unbearable pain had left her housebound. During her recovery she gained weight from being wheelchair-bound, going from 9½ st to 21st, while post-traumatic stress disorder caused her to lose her hair. With the help of doctors Miss Campbell, from Northampton, rebuilt herself with a £52,500 makeover including a prosthetic leg, make-up which is tattooed on, Botox, gastric band weight loss treatment, a tummy tuck and hair extensions. She even treated herself to breast enlargements. She underwent a £52,500 makeover after she gained weight from being wheelchair-bound after her leg was amputated following the blast . Although doctors told her she would never conceive again, she gave birth to Lexi-River on March 31 last year. But when Lexi-River was ten days old, Miss Campbell suffered excruciating stomach pain and was rushed to hospital. Miss Campbell was previously married to husband Jamie, father to their daughter Milly . She said: ‘It was like history was repeating itself as I lost so much of Milly’s childhood having operations and recovering after the blast.’ Doctors found she had a perforated ulcer and operated to stem the bleeding. Six months later she developed a larger ulcer, which perforated. She said: ‘I ended up with 40 staples holding my stomach together. I was in hospital all over Christmas and finally got out in early January this year.’ Last weekend she was readmitted with stomach pains, but she was determined not to miss Lexi-River’s birthday on Tuesday and checked herself out 24 hours before, getting home in time to make cupcakes with Milly for the party. Miss Campbell said: ‘Because of everything I’ve been through celebrating Lexi-River’s first birthday is a milestone not only for her, but also for me. In my darkest times I feared I wasn’t going to make it, but I just couldn’t give up because of my two daughters.’ She will spend the next month having tests as doctors explore the possibility she may have a rare condition which is causing her stomach to ulcerate.\",\n",

Locals were shocked to learn the location had been rented out to American Adult film company Brazzers . In the opening scene of the pornographic film a young woman dressed as a school girl walks along the clearly recognisable train station platform. The storyline, which is apparently set in the 1940s, then moves to one of the attraction's wooden-panelled train carriages where the pair have sex on the seats. Parents were quoted as saying they were disgusted and mortified by the decision to use the railway as the setting for the porn film, which has now been viewed more than 235,000 times. Mum-of-two Amanda Mendel from Fyfield Road in Rainham, Essex said it did not seem right that the railway should present itself as a family business and then allow the filming of 'an orgy train'. She said she would be think twice about taking her children on the railway after what had gone on. Mrs Mendel added that the whole thing was 'disgusting'. Similarly Carla Ince 41 from in Brentwood Road in Marden Ash, said it was 'terrible' and a 'stupid, disgusting decision'. She highlighted its hypocrisy explaining that the Epping Ongar railway advertised itself for Christmas and Easter events. Parents were quoted as saying they were disgusted and mortified by the decision to use the railway . Epping Ognar Railway has apologised for allowing the railway to be used as a backdrop for pornography . Epping Ognar Railway has apologised for allowing the heritage railway to be used as a backdrop for pornography. Its business development manager, Dean Wilton, said the decision was an 'error of judgement' and that the attraction had put in place policy safeguards to ensure the refusal of 'any further approaches for this kind of production'. He apologised for a second time for any offence caused. Originally opened in 1865 as the final section of the Eastern Railway Branch line, the Epping Ognar Railway was run by London Underground from 1949. It ran until 1994 when it was closed and its passenger service was withdrawn. It lay in disuse until restoration to turn it into a historic site began in 1994. The heritage line operates between Ongar through North Weald to the boundary of the London Underground’s Central line. It is connected to a historic bus line which connects North Weald to Epping tube station for the ease of its customers. The railway is predominantly staffed by volunteers as indeed are most heritage lines. The Ongar Epping line has been lovingly restored to ensure its features closely resemble the historical past. The station and signal signalbox at Ongar has been painted and recreated to look as it would have on the Great Eastern Railway in the 19th Century.

More than 7million front lawns in Britain have now been paved over - raising the risk of flooding and reducing available habitats for wildlife. And there are not just environmental consequences of replacing grass and wild flowers with brick, as the sight of a green garden is said to boost people's mood. More than 7million gardens in Britain have now been paved over and the RHS is calling for people to plant hedges, trees and flowers to turn the UK green again - as grassy well kept gardens boost mood . The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) is calling on people to\\xa0plant trees, shrubs, climbers, hedges or flowers to attract wildlife, improve air quality and reduce urban temperatures and the risk of flooding. Alistair Griffiths, RHS director of science and collections, said: 'Many of us get a boost by simply looking at a beautiful garden or having access to green space. 'So instead of paving over green we can all play a part in reducing the grey and brightening it, and us, up with some plants. 'On top of making us feel better and happier, if hundreds and thousands of people across the country across the country grew more plants of different varieties in gardens and community spaces, it would all help to improve our air quality, benefit us, our wildlife and reduce temperatures and flooding risks. The society has issued advise for people to transform their gardens by planting a tree, hedge and a shrub . The RHS has launched a three year 'greening grey Britain' campaign in a bid to transform 6,000 unloved grey, concrete spaces into planted-up areas. A survey of 2,000 people by the organisation found that 95 per cent thought being in a beautiful garden lifted their mood. More than 60 per cent said looking at a street of paved-over front gardens saddened them. The RHS says replace paving with plants . The RHS has suggested people can transform their concrete front gardens by planting five things; . a tree - intercept intense rain and slow run-off, helping reduce risk of floods . a hedge - provide areas of shade . a shrub - create extra habitats for wildlife which can promote growing of more plants . a climber - cool buildings . a perennial plant - reduce pressure on drains which can lead to flash flooding . The poll also found that 60 per cent of people worry about paved front gardens and flooding. The society is offering tips on how to transform grey areas. Tips include pulling up a paving stone and planting it up, to creating window boxes and planting trees and climbers in front gardens which can cool buildings. Around 30,000 volunteers who worked on the Britain in Bloom competition will also help transform concrete Britain into a greener space in the three years of the campaign.\",\n",

HIV specialists and network security experts at University College London (UCL) made the disovery after creating a simulation of how the virus spreads . They worked together to build a model for this 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say early treatment is key to staving off AIDS. Scroll down for video . Researchers creates a model 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say the spread was similar to a computer virus . HIV infects CD4+ T-cells, which play a vital role in the immune system and protect us from diseases. As HIV progresses, it reduces the number of active T-cells in the body until the immune system cannot function correctly, a state known as 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' or AIDS. Current World Health Organisation guidelines, which the UK government follows, recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level. However, the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing in the long term. The teams noticed that the spread of HIV through the body using two methods - via the bloodstream and directly between cells - was similar to how some computer worms spread through both the internet and local networks respectively to infect as many computers as possible. The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the highly damaging 'Conficker' worm, first detected in 2008, which has infected military and police computer networks across Europe and is still active today. Lead author Changwang Zhang, of UCL, said: 'HIV and Conficker have a lot in common. 'They both use hybrid spreading mechanisms, persist for a very long time and are incredibly difficult to eradicate. 'Our model enables us to explain these important properties and to predict the infection process.' Changwang's supervisor co-author Dr Shi Zhou said: 'Although the cybersecurity community organised an unprecedented collaboration to tackle Conficker, they still failed to eliminate Conficker from the Internet. 'HIV researchers face a similar problem. We hope that our new understanding of hybrid epidemics will help us to fight against Conficker and HIV.' Detailed sample data from 17 HIV patients from London were used to verify the model, showing that hybrid spreading provides the best explanation for HIV progression and highlighting the benefits of early treatment.

Current World Health Organisation guidelines, which the UK government follows, recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level. However, the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing in the long term. Co-senior author Professor Benny Chain, of UCL, said: 'The number of HIV cells in the bloodstream is always relatively low, and our model shows that HIV spread through the bloodstream alone would not be enough to cause AIDS. The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the highly damaging 'Conficker' worm, first detected in 2008, which has infected military and police computer networks across Europe and is still active today. 'It is likely that when HIV gains a foothold somewhere with a high T-cell population, such as the gut, it uses a cell-to-cell transfer mechanism to efficiently spread directly between them. As such, if HIV has already spread to an area rich in T-cells by the time treatment begins, preventing its spread through the bloodstream will not stop AIDS. 'Our model suggests that completely blocking cell-to-cell transfer would prevent progression to AIDS, highlighting the need to develop new treatments.' Laboratory research, led by co-senior author Dr Clare Jolly, has previously shown that some drugs are better than others at stopping HIV from spreading directly between cells. However, it's not possible to directly measure cell-to-cell spread in patients because it takes place inside internal organs. Dr Jolly said: 'With this new model, we should be able to assess the effectiveness of drugs against different modes of HIV spread in real patients. 'This could prove invaluable when interpreting the results of drug trials to understand what works and why. Using computer models to understand processes that we cannot directly observe is common in the physical sciences and supports many fundamental theories. 'Our model provides strong evidence that cell-to-cell spread is an important part of HIV spread, and we hope to show this directly in future animal studies.'.\",\n",

Shameless Mike Holpin – who at 56 says he wants more children – claims he had them by 20 women and admits he would not recognise many of his offspring in the street. Now engaged again, the three-times married man keeps track of their names with an ever-growing family tree tattooed on his back. 'I won't stop': Father of 40 Mike Holpin, left and right with his fiancée Diane, says he wants more children because it is 'God's will' His relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising, and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives. If they had completed just one year in care each, it would leave the taxpayer with a bill for £2.4million. Mr Holpin or the children’s mothers would also have been able to claim at least £500,000 in child benefit and a further £800,000 in child tax credits. On top of this, he has claimed at least £675,000 in benefits himself. Yet the feckless dad, of Ebbw Vale in South Wales, said: ‘I’ll never stop [having children]. Never stop. In the Bible, God says go forth and multiply. I’m doing what God wants.’ Keeping track: Mr Holpin, from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, shows off his family tree tattoo - which includes his children and grandchildren . He was the subject of a Channel 5 documentary this week, but last night former friends said Holpin’s claim to 40 children – aged between three and 37 – was nonsense. And as 40 Kids By 20 Women aired, his ex-wife Petrina told of her embarrassment on Facebook, writing: ‘Feeling Asshamed’ (sic). Mr Holpin, who lives in a council house and claims benefits, said he was a changed man who no longer drank alcohol. But he still wants more children. He added: ‘I’m as fertile as sin. I don’t believe in contraception and I love sex. Most of my kids have gone through the care system. 'It makes me feel like s*** because they’ve suffered. They [social services] took them from me because I’m an alcoholic. I’m still an alcoholic – I just don’t practise it.’ Family: Holpin says that he loves sex and won't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care . TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: ‘It is the lack of shame that really sticks in the throat and taxpayers will be furious. 'It is sheer arrogance to keep having children as if they were hot dinners and expect other people to pick up the bill.’ But former friends say Mr Holpin’s boasts are off the mark, and that he has fathered as few as 16 children with three women. One said he had ‘padded’ his numbers by including his ex-partner’s stepchildren. He added: ‘He’s no angel after a drink but he isn’t the big ladies’ man that he likes to think he is. 'He’s definitely had a football team’s worth of little ’uns – maybe 16 – just because he’s not fussy and not careful. But no way has he got two rugby teams and all the subs to make it up to 40.’ Offspring: Holpin admits his lifestyle led to 16 of his children being taken into care but says he wants to make it up to them . Mr Holpin and his family are infamous in the former mining town of Ebbw Vale, where locals have launched petitions to stop him moving into their street. He now lives with his fiancee Diane Morris, ten years his junior, in a council house in the village of Cwm. Mr Holpin’s daughter Rhiannon, 19, said on Facebook yesterday: ‘You can all hate but it doesn’t matter, there’s plenty of us to stick up for each other and we can take on the lot of you. ‘I feel like I can’t even leave my house without people judging. Get off my back, I didn’t ask my dad to do what he’s done with his life.’ Dream: Mr Holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect . Day out: Mike and Diane with some of the children at their local bowling alley . New life: The father-of-40 lives with his fiancée Diane Morris, ten years his junior, and they live in a two-bed council house in South Wales. Mr Holpin’s brother, David, 59, said the former fairground worker’s ‘shocking’ behaviour had brought ‘shame’ on the family. David Holpin, from Erith, Kent, added: ‘I lost touch with Mike when I moved to Kent 18 years ago – he didn’t have a phone so we couldn’t keep in touch. ‘It wouldn’t surprise me if he had 40 children, the way he carries on. His behaviour is shocking. I’m not ashamed of Michael, but I’m upset about the way our family name has been tarnished. ‘He has brought shame on us, and we are a good family.’\",\n",

According to the police report, Messerchmitt left his work at law film, DLA Piper, around 7.45pm on February 9 and texted his wife a couple of hours later to say he would back at their Capitol Hill home in an hour. The couple reportedly had not seen each other since February 8, but Vuong didn't think anything seemed wrong with her husband. She reported him missing at midnight, saying it was unlike him to disappear and that usually he got home before her. Messerschmitt was found dead in his room the next day. Police have not revealed exactly what he was doing at the hotel. Last week, Messerchmitt's wife gave an emotional speech, asking for help in finding her husband's killer. 'The world has lost a good person. David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said.

It may not turn into a bloodthirsty beast in the moonlight, but a peculiar plant does rely on the lunar cycle to survive. Called Ephedra foeminea, the plant waits for the full moon to 'bloom' and is the only plant species so far that’s known to behave in this way. At night, the non-flowering relative of conifers secretes tiny droplets of sugary fluid to attract pollinating insects. They ooze from the plant’s female organs where seeds are produced. When a nocturnal butterfly or insect lands on one of the tasty transparent orbs at night, the pollen it’s carrying is used to fertilise the seed. Researchers from Stockholm University noticed the droplets at the same time of the year having conducted four years of research, New Scientist reported. When they went to study the plants in Macedonia, Greece and Dalmatia in Croatia in 2013, they were baffled as to why the orbs were not there, but after abandoning their field work to get some dinner, noticed that there was no moon this time. They checked data to see whether the creation of the globules coincided with the full moon and were shocked to find they did. Researcher Catarina Rydin said: ‘It all fitted, and all we had to do was wait for 2014's full moon in July to see if that was what the plants were waiting for, and it absolutely was.’ The study, published in Biology Letters, says: ‘The exact timing of pollination in E. foeminea varied considerably from year to year, but was correlated with the full moon of July.’ The study, published in Biology Letters, says: ‘The exact timing of pollination in E. foeminea varied considerably from year to year, but was correlated with the full moon of July.’ \\xa0A stock image showing the phases of the moon is pictured . Dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung. Badgers tend to raise their leg to urinate at full moon, to mark their territory before mating, LiveScience reported. Corals release huge amounts of sperm and eggs at full moon. By synchronising spawning, they increase the chances of eggs being fertilised. While lions hunt most effectively at night, they sometimes kill during the day when there's a full moon. Pets injure themselves more when the moon is full, although there is no reason why. A study found a 28 per cent increase in dog visits to the vets and 23 per cent increase for cats. ‘To our astonishment, even cones that appeared too young to be pollinated… secreted pollination drops from a pore-shaped micropylar opening during the peaking period at full moon. ‘One to two weeks earlier, when the moon was new and in its first quarter, we observed the exact opposite; drop secretion was weak to non-existent and pollinators were absent.’ While the globules materialised on E. foeminea at full moon, the same was not true of a relative found in the area. It’s unknown how the plant ‘knows’ when it’s full moon, but they can detect different intensities of light during the phases of the moon as well as gravity, which they could potentially use to identify lunar phases. While E. foeminea may be the first plant to respond to the lunar cycle, numerous animals are known to experience behaviour changes at different times during the cycle. For example, dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung and crabs and seabirds are also said to use the moon to carry out daily activities. Ephedra foeminea is the only known plant species to follow the lunar cycle, but dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung (a stock image is shown) and crabs and seabirds are also said to use the moon to carry out daily activities . ‘Correlation with the lunar cycle has been described regarding activity, reproduction, communication and navigation for a number of vertebrates and invertebrates,’ the study says. ‘Even eyeless animals such as reef corals correlate their reproduction with the phases of the moon. ‘Therefore, it is not surprising that the moon can influence plants as well, e.g. as a consequence of plant–animal interactions.’ Dr Rydin said: ‘To the best of our knowledge, this is a first. ‘At night, the many pollination drops glitter like diamonds in the full moonlight, a spectacular sight also for the human eye.’\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"The Large Hadron Collider was restarted today after being turned off for two years during a major renovation project that cost £100million. The world's largest atom-smashing machine is most famous for proving the existence of the Higgs boson - but scientists hope it will now unlock even more fundamental secrets of the universe. Physicists at Cern, the Geneva-based organisation which runs the LHC, are aiming to see dark matter for the first time ever thanks to the device's upgrade. Scroll down for video . Back to work: The Large Hadron Collider is operating again after two years being upgraded . The LHC is situated underground below the border between Switzerland and France, and consists of nearly 17 miles of circular tunnels. It was shut down two years ago - after confirming the discovery of the Higgs boson - so that its energy levels could be almost doubled, allowing scientists to carry out more extreme experiments. The re-opening was delayed by another couple of weeks thanks to a short circuit in the system, but this morning it started operating again at last. After two beams of particles were sent flying through the tunnels at a speed just slower than light, Cern's director general Rolf Heuer said: 'Congratulations. Thank you very much everyone... now the hard work starts.' Workers - who were earlier given Easter eggs by one of the centre's bosses - cheered when it was confirmed that the machine was back in operation. Ambition: Scientists hope the machine will be able to detect and describe dark matter for the first time . The LHC, which cost nearly £4billion, is currently running at a low 'injection' energy of 450 giga-electron volts (GeV), but in June it will increase to a record-breaking 13 tera-electron volts (TeV) - up from 7 TeV at the time it managed to detect the Higgs boson in 2013. British scientist Peter Higgs was awarded the Nobel Prize after the discovery of the particle, which he and others predicted would exist but which had never been seen until the construction of the LHC. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. Now the physicists operating the machine have their sights on dark matter, the invisible, undetectable material that makes up 84 per cent of matter in the universe and binds galaxies together yet whose nature is unknown. If they are able to detect and describe dark matter, it will mark a huge leap forward in our understanding of the universe. Cern spokesman Arnaud Marsollier said: 'The LHC will be running day and night. When we will get results we don't know. What is important is that we will have collisions at energies we've never had before. 'If something interesting appears in this new window we will see it. It might be two months from now or two years, we're not able to say. 'It took 50 years to find the Higgs boson and 20 years to build this machine, and it will be running at least until 2035, so we can be patient.' Particles of protons, the 'hearts' of atoms, travel round the LHC at just three metres per second below the speed of light. When experiments begin they will be smashed together in four giant detectors located around the beam ring, sparking the creation of new particles and hopefully opening up a new era in physics. The search for dark matter involves moving beyond the Standard Model, the all-encompassing theory describing the particles and forces of nature that has stood firm for the past 50 years. Inside: The LHC consists of an enormous circular tunnel which is nearly 17 miles long . A 'new physics' model of the universe called supersymmetry predicts that every known particle has a more massive partner - and one of these elusive supersymmetry particles might be the source of dark matter. Professor Jonathan Butterworth, from University College London, said: 'It all seemed to go very well this morning. We'll all be watching very excitedly to see what develops over the next few weeks. The LHC's operating again for the first time in two years and that's a really important milestone in physics. 'You can think of the LHC as the world's greatest microscope looking into the heart of matter. At this higher energy level we don't know what we'll see - no-one has looked there before. 'It would be absolutely lovely to find a candidate for dark matter. That's a fairly glaring hole in our theory. Supersymmetry particles are a good candidate, but they're not the only candidate. 'The fact that we don't know what most of the universe is made of is really what drives me on.' As well as dark matter, the team is hoping to discover more Higgs bosons and other 'exotic particles' which have never been detected before. They also believe they could uncover the existence of extra dimensions, which may explain why gravity is weaker than theoretical models would predict. And the LHC could cast light on antimatter, particles which are identical to normal matter but with the opposite charge. However, some have expressed concerns that the machine could be seriously unsafe, as its high-energy experiments create conditions similar to black holes which could have catastrophic consequences. Professor Andy Parker, head of physics at Cambridge University, said: 'This is a very exciting time for scientists as the Large Hadron Collider restarts after a major upgrade. 'The current Standard Model explains the known particles and forces, and the discovery of the Higgs completed that picture. But the Standard Model does not explain dark matter, which is believed to make up most of the universe, nor dark energy, a mysterious force driving the galaxies ever further apart. 'Interestingly, the answers to these problems in cosmology might lie in the realm of sub-atomic physics studied at Cern. The LHC might be able to produce dark matter particles for example, which would be glimpsed in the debris of collisions detected by the Atlas and CMS experiments. 'Even more exciting is the possibility that the universe could have more than three space dimensions, and that other spaces are hidden all around us.' And Professor Dave Newbold, who heads the particle physics group at the University of Bristol, added: 'The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 was a huge breakthrough, but the real excitement starts now. 'The upgraded LHC will allow us to probe further than ever before, and to explore brand new scientific territory such as dark matter.'\",\n",

At the same time, she issued a demand for a huge inflation-busting increase in the State pension, which would cost billions of pounds more. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week. It is currently £113. Parts of Scotland have among the lowest life expectancies of any part of the UK. In central Glasgow it is less than 73 years for men and for women less than 79. Across Scotland the figure is about 76 for men and 80 for women. In England and Wales the figures are nearly 79 for men and nearly 83 for women. But various studies have linked lower life expectancy in Scotland to higher rates of alcohol consumption, smoking, and poor diet. It is also linked to levels of poverty and housing.

Speaking on a visit to a care home in East Dunbartonshire, Miss Sturgeon said: ‘The Tory/Lib Dem government’s plan to further increase the state pension age is a worry to people across the UK who are planning for their future, but the failure to take Scotland’s specific circumstances into account is particularly unfair. ‘Our comparatively low life expectancy rate is an issue which I will do everything in my power to change but in the meantime it would be completely unacceptable for people in Scotland who have paid in to a state pension all of their lives to lose out.’ ‘That is why SNP MPs will reject any plans for a further increase in the state pension age.’ ‘Our pensioners have contributed hugely to society and are entitled to get a fair deal in their retirement in return. She said the SNP would ensure that ‘the contribution older people have made throughout their lives is recognised’ if they hold the balance of power after the election. Miss Sturgeon also issued a demand for the single tier pension to increase to at least ‘to ensure pensioners are no longer subjected to the scourge of means-tested benefits.’ The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped . A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘Capping the state pension age in Scotland will cost hardworking taxpayers across Britain more than £12.5 billion. ‘This gives another glimpse into a future with Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, in the SNP’s pocket – meaning more borrowing, more spending, and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’ On Sunday Miss Sturgeon said the SNP would be prepared to prop up a minority Labour government even if Ed Miliband lost the election. She said the party’s MPs would vote to support Labour even if the party won fewer seats than the Conservatives on May 7. The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped. For many years, the UK state pension age for men was 65 and the state pension age for women was 60. But from 2020, both men and women’s retirement age will be 66, increasing to 67 between 2026 and 2028, and then linked to life expectancy after that. The government will then review the state pension age every five years. During last year’s referendum campaign, the SNP argued the level should only increase to 66 in Scotland, because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between £10,000 and £11,000 less.',\n",

The drug was developed by the British pharmaceutical giant Astra Zeneca with the original aim of treating certain types of tumour, but was shelved after it proved ineffective. Scientists at Yale University in Connecticut in the US have revealed how the treatment, called AZDO5030, restored memory in mice given Alzheimer's disease. An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed (file picture) The drug worked by blocking a process that breaks nerve connections in the brain used to store memory. Researchers say the study has led to the launch of human trials to test the efficacy of the drug in Alzheimer's patients. Stephen Strittmatter, the author of the report, published in Annals of Neurology, said: 'With this treatment, cells under bombardment by beta amyloid plaques show restored synaptic connections and reduced inflammation, and the animal’s memory, which was lost during the course of the disease, comes back. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health which launched a programme to test failed drugs on different diseases. Mr Strittmatter and his co-author Christopher van Dyck have already started a 'multi-site clinical trial' to determine whether the drug can also benefit Alzheimer's patients. According to the Alzheimer's Society, there are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain - a figure that includes 40,000 younger people. The charity estimates that 60,000 deaths are attributable to dementia every year and that there will be one million people with the disease in the UK by 2025. It reports that the financial cost of dementia to the UK is £26billion a year. The Daily Express reports the charity's head of research Dr James Pickett as giving the latest treatment a cautious welcome. He said: 'Drug development can take decades, so repurposing pre-existing drugs for dementia is a promising avenue to find new treatments as they have been shown to be safe to use in people and can lead to clinical trials sooner. 'As we learn more about the causes of dementia, there is hope that treatments we routinely use for other diseases may also work for people with dementia.'\",\n",

Lisa Williams, 49, hit taxi driver David Coleman three times after finding the\\xa054-year-old brawling with her brother in the street, a court heard. The two families had been 'neighbours at war' since the Colemans moved in next door to the Williams family on St Catherine’s Road, Chingford, in 2007. Lisa Williams (pictured leaving court, left) hit taxi driver David Coleman (right) three times with the hammer during a street fight . On the morning of the attack, the court heard that William's sibling Jonathan\\xa0had smeared mud all over the Coleman's front bay windows. When the victim went to confront him, they got into a fight. James Benson, prosecuting, said: ‘Mr Coleman is not a small man but fairly well built, Jonathan Williams is bigger built still and is in fact a younger man than Mr Coleman,’ he said. ‘Between the two of them punches were thrown by both parties, this was before Lisa Williams had anything to do with the incident. ‘Ultimately the parties say Mr Williams gained the upper hand in the fight as the bigger and younger man, and both me went to the ground.’ At that point the bigger man allegedly straddled Mr Coleman as Williams emerged from their house holding a claw hammer, she then struck him three times to the head. She was only stopped when a third neighbour Bernard Mason, pulled the hammer out of her hands, and his wife Pamela was forced to sit on the her until the police arrived. Williams admitted striking Mr Coleman with a hammer, but claimed she believed he was about to kill her brother and she acted out of panic. Warring neighbours: The two families were described as ‘neighbours at war’ after\\xa0the Colemans (left) moved in next door to the Williams' home (right) Before fetching the hammer she called 999 from  house she shared with her brother and mother, who can be heard screaming ‘leave him alone, leave him alone’ in the background. Williams was convicted of unlawfully wounding Mr Coleman after a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in February. Mr Benson described the two families as ‘neighbours at war’. The victim told the court that the Williams family had an irrational hatred of him. He claimed they would throw dog faeces over their garden fence and let their pet bark all hours of the day. Mr Coleman also believed they would be deliberately noisy and bang on the walls in the morning so he couldn't sleep after a night shift. However, Recorder Richard Sutton told the family ‘it takes two to Tango’. In a victim impact statement, Mr Coleman said he still suffers headaches and anxiety as a result of the attack, and often has to take days off work as a result. Isobel McCarroll, for Williams, said: ‘On the day in questions they were doing home improvements, her brother was out the front and she was doing some gardening, the hammer was in the hallway. ‘She came across an incident that was in full swing, she was nothing to do with the initial fighting - she came across something that must have been a terrifying scene and she rang 999 first.’ Williams, 49, was jailed for 30 months today at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London (pictured) after she was found guilty of maliciously wounding Mr Coleman . ‘She then went and tried to split the parties up, she went back in and she didn’t know if she was going to call 999 again and when she was in she saw the hammer - it might go a considerable way to mitigating the actions that followed. ‘It was three blows in quick succession and thankfully it was stopped by Mr Mason.’ She said Williams, who has no previous convictions, has been living apart from her family for two years since the incident and the family are now selling their home on St Catherine’s Road. Jailing Williams for two years and six months, the judge said: ‘You find yourself in a very, very sad situation as you no doubt appreciate, and it has come about because of the situation that has evolved between you and your neighbours. ‘This in my view was an incident waiting to happen and it was going to be serious and both sides were quite prepared for confrontation as and when it arose. ‘That’s the problem if it becomes violent, you never quite know where it is going to end - I understand that you thought the only way to respond to what was taking place was to arm yourself and it’s that action that the law finds unallowable and therefore criminal. ‘I accept that there was a substantial amount of provocation’. Williams was also barred from contacting the Coleman family indefinitely and ordered to pay a £120 surcharge.\",\n",

The Labour leader’s secret cribsheets also reveal how he planned to ‘relish the chance to show who I am’. And in handwritten notes, Mr Miliband appears to exhort himself to ‘use the people at home’. Embarrassingly for the Labour leader, the ten pages of notes were apparently left behind in the Salford ITV studios where Mr Miliband clashed with David Cameron, Nick Clegg and four other party leaders. Scroll down for video . Embarrassing:\\xa0Ed Miliband faced ridicule last night after privately billing himself as the ‘happy warrior’ ahead of last week’s televised Election debate . Mr Miliband faced criticism last week for his ‘stiff’, mannered performance – including turning to look straight into the TV camera shortly after each question from the studio audience. But his discarded notes, according to the Sun on Sunday, reveal the extraordinary lengths he went to in his determined bid to get the better of his political opponents. One note appears to explain why Mr Miliband smiled serenely every time he came under fire. It read: ‘Happy warrior, calm, never agitated.’ Last night, Labour sources suggested that was a reference to the poem The Character Of The Happy Warrior by William Wordsworth. In a further self-motivational message, Mr Miliband, pictured during the debate as Natalie Bennet speaks, also wrote the words ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ connected by an arrow. But the notes also betray the vital importance for the Labour leader of landing a blow on the Prime Minister – and contrasting himself with Mr Cameron. He wrote ‘me versus DC’, followed by ‘decency, principle and values’. In a further self-motivational message, Mr Miliband also wrote the words ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ connected by an arrow. The Labour leader’s notes also reveal that several of his most successful ripostes were carefully scripted in advance. Last night, a Labour spokesman said: ‘These notes will come as no surprise. They explain why and how Ed took on David Cameron over the NHS and living standards' Looking down: Labour Party leader Ed Miliband leaves MediaCityUK in Salford following the televised leaders' election debate . For example, after Mr Cameron reminded the Labour leader of his alleged plan to ‘weaponise’ the NHS, Mr Miliband’s quickfire retort – ‘I would say to everybody at home: Use your vote as a weapon to fight for the future of the health service’ – was drawn virtually word for word from his notes. Last night, a Labour spokesman said: ‘These notes will come as no surprise. They explain why and how Ed took on David Cameron over the NHS and living standards. ‘They also show how Ed set out a positive vision for the future with Labour’s better plan, including on zero-hours contracts, lower tuition fees and rents.’ Our surveys said: After four opinion polls were released, the average poll of polls put Mr Cameron narrowly ahead on 22 per cent, with 21.5 per cent saying Mr Miliband won, 21 per cent backing Mr Farage and 20 per cent favouring Miss Sturgeon .\",\n",

Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, has claimed the 63-year-old Hollywood producer asked her for a kiss and groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night. But while Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed. 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the\\xa0New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' See below for video . Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse on Thursday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police that the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night . DailyMail.com has reached out to his representatives for comment. She also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he knew he was being monitored but following the call and the meeting at the restaurant at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, Weinstein voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. The alleged incident unfolded at Weinstein's Tribeca office after he invited her there for a business meeting on Friday night, hours after meeting her at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night. When she arrived at the office, the married father-of-five allegedly asked if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt, she told police. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. She clearly rejected him and he backed off, the New York Daily News reported, and she fled from the building. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she quickly left the building half an hour after arriving, the newspaper reported. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with Weinstein, who is behind hit movies including Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech and Gangs Of New York. 'When she was describing what happened, her face became contorted,' said Mark Heller. 'It was that look of someone who was creeped out. She's a very young woman who was relating her disgust that a much older man - an old man in view of someone her age - conducted himself like that.' Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Weinstein's camp have dismissed Miss Battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . It also emerged that she told Italian police in 2010 that she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with €2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Harvey Weinstein to 'discuss business' After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter.

She says at one point during their relationship, Castro popped the question but Roldan declined since she didn\\'t believe in marriage. After the proposal, Castro remained dedicated to Roldan and even bought her a ruby ring. After buying the flashy piece of jewelry, Castro took Roldan along to one of his music gigs where he had yet another romantic gesture in store. Free women: Amanda Berry (left), Gina DeJesus (center) and Michelle Knight (right), were held captive in Castro\\'s home for years. They found freedom in May 2013, when Berry\\'s 6-year-old child helped the trio escape . Stolen youth: Castro kidnapped Michelle Knight (right) in 2002 when she was 21, eight months later he kidnapped then 17-year-old Amanda Berry (left). A year later, he captured 14-year-old Gina DeJesus (center) Mid-way through the performance, he took the microphone and told the audience: \\'Today, I gave my girlfriend Lillian a ring.\\' \\'So everyone clapped,\\' Lillian recalls. \\'And he told the group that he wanted to sing \"La Bamba\" for me. It was so romantic and I was charmed. It was such a special [night] and he really did show me love.\\' While Castro remained the normal man she called her boyfriend, two years into their relationship he started harboring a secret at home. In August 2002, Castro kidnapped then 21-year-old Michelle Knight and locked her in his basement. Eight months later, he kidnapped another girl, 17-year-old Amanda Berry. Apparently distracted by the two young women that he was torturing at home, Castro abruptly cut ties with Roldan in October of that year, sending her a letter that said he \\'didn\\'t love her enough to stay.\\' Prison: Above, Catro\\'s Cleveland home where he kept the three women locked up for years . Five months after Roldan received the unexpected break-up letter, Castro\\'s third victim, Gina DeJesus, went missing. She was 14 years old at the time. For the next nine years the women were locked inside Castro\\'s home and kept secret from the outside world. The three women found freedom in May 2013, when Berry\\'s 6-year-old daughter by Castro helped the trio to escape the house and alert police. Castro was arrested and sentenced to life in prison plus $1,000 years. About a month after his sentencing, Castro committed suicide in prison.',\n",

But while the majority of people believe their drinking habits are under control, one in five young professionals now considers themselves to have a problem with alcohol, a survey found. A new poll laying bare the public's attitudes to drinking found nearly half of young workers think it is acceptable to regularly get drunk on a night out, compared to a fifth of the general population. It also revealed the risky effects of drinking, as young people admitted to forgetting how they got home, driving themselves home drunk or getting in a car with someone they knew was intoxicated. One in five young professionals now considers themselves to have a dirnking problem, a survey found . The news comes after a shocking report published this week found binge drinking costs the British economy £4.9bn every year in terms of treating drunks in A&E, road crashes, police arrests and court cases. The damning report said current policies on alcohol taxation are failing to keep up with the financial consequences of people drinking to excess, and calls for minimum unit prices to offset these costs. The new poll of 4,000 British adults found 7 per cent reported they have a drinking problem. Among young professionals, this figure rose to 21 per cent, with 28 per cent of men in this saying they believe they have a problem. More than a third (35 per cent) of 18 to 24-year-olds said they had got so drunk they could not remember most of their night out, with one in five (18 per cent) admitting they have not been able to recall how they got home. One in 20 admitted to driving themselves home drunk and one in ten said they have got in a car with someone who they knew was intoxicated. A survey of 4,000 British adults revealed: . 7 per cent reported they have a drinking problem . 21 per cent of young professionals said they had a drinking professionals, with the figure rising to 28 per cent for men alone . 35 per cent of 18-24-year-olds said they had got so drunk they could not remember most of their night out, . 18 per cent admitted they have not been able to recall how they got home . 5 per cent admitted to driving themselves home drunk . 10 per cent got in a car with someone intoxicated . Among 25 to 34-year-olds 16 per cent said they have woken up in a stranger's house . 23 per cent of 35-54-year-olds said they drink at home alone . Another 23 per cent considered alcohol to be more harmful to their health than smoking . 53 per cent said the NHS should refrain from treating alcoholics . 54 per cent said it is not acceptable to drink when pregnant . Among 25 to 34-year-olds 16 per cent said they have woken up in a stranger's house. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of those aged 35 to 54 said they drink alone at home, with many saying they do it to relieve stress or relax. When asked about the dangers of drinking, three quarters of those polled said they believed Britain has a heavy drinking culture. Just over a fifth (23 per cent) considered alcohol to be more harmful to their health than smoking. While a sizeable proportion of people admitted to problematic drinking, the survey revealed tough attitudes to alcohol abuse. More than half of those questioned believe the NHS should refrain from treating people who continue to abuse alcohol after warnings about their health. A similar number (54 per cent) said it is not acceptable to drink while pregnant. Alistair Bohm, head of communications at drug and alcohol treatment charity Addaction, said: 'Problems with alcohol use can affect people of any age, from any background. 'As these statistics show, it's not just people who are addicted to alcohol who are damaging their health or risking their safety as a result of drinking. 'If a person is worried about their drinking, the best thing to do is speak to their doctor, or find their nearest addiction services.' The World Health Organisation estimates there are 3.3 million deaths each year as a result of harmful use of alcohol. Doctors warn long term alcohol misuse is a major risk factor for conditions including heart disease, stroke, liver disease, and certain cancers. The survey was carried out by Opinium Research. Almost a quarter (23 per cent) considered alcohol to be more harmful to their health than smoking .\",\n",

The system would allow machines to download them in a similar way to an app - and even have a different personality for each user. The patent says that the personality could replicate the robot's owner, 'a deceased loved one,' or 'a celebrity,' Scroll down for video . The California giant's patent says that the robot personality could replicate the robot's owner, 'a deceased loved one,' or 'a celebrity.' Above it Atlas, which according to Google-owned Boston Dynamics, is a 'high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough terrain. According to Google owned Boston Dynamics, Atlas is a 'high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough terrain. 'Atlas can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift, carry, and manipulate the environment. 'In extremely challenging terrain, Atlas is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet, to pick its way through congested spaces.' Google's patent details a cloud-based system where a personality could be downloaded to a robot, in the same way one might download an app. 'The robot personality may also be modifiable within a base personality construct (i.e., a default-persona) to provide states or moods representing transitory conditions of happiness, fear, surprise, perplexion (e.g., the Woody Allen robot), thoughtfulness, derision (e.g., the Rodney Dangerfield robot), and so forth,' states the patent. Friends will even be able to clone their robots and swap aspects of its personality. 'The personality and state may be shared with other robots so as to clone this robot within another device or devices. 'In this manner, a user may travel to another city, and download within a robot in that city (another 'skin') the personality and state matching the user's 'home location' robot. 'The robot personality thereby becomes transportable or transferable.' The firm also explains 'This disclosure relates to a robot imbued with a personality, or personalities. 'In particular, but without limitation, the disclosure provides for a robot that operates with personality attributes and related capabilities drawn from cloud computing capacities. 'Personality may be thought of as personification in the sense of human characteristics or qualities attributed to a non-human thing. 'A robot can be programmed to provide a desired look as well as interactability for the robot, which may be subject to change by the user or by the robot itself, such that the robot interface is customized to provide a desired personality for the robot.' Google already owns several firms developing robotic technology, including Atlas, 6.2 feet of metal with a plastic body that can walk, run, jump and even open doors. This is latest version of the Atlas robot created by Boston Dynamics, a Google-owned robot firm. Later this year, seven of the robots will compete in a 'robo oylmpics' - designed to recreate natural disasters the robots could one day be sent into. A total of $3.5 million in prizes will now be awarded to the top three finishers in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC), the final event of which will be held June 5-6, 2015, at Fairplex in California. Aside from the previously announced $2 million grand prize, DARPA plans to award $1 million to the runner-up and $500,000 to the third-place team. Google's patent drawings reveal the system can share personalities and download them . DARPA expects at least twenty teams to compete in the DRC Finals. 'The goal of the DRC is to generate groundbreaking research and development in hardware and software that will enable future robots, in tandem with human counterparts, to perform the most hazardous activities in disaster zones, thus reducing casualties and saving lives,' it said. The teams using the DARPA-developed Atlas robot will use an entirely new version, which is battery powered for the first time. The Atlas robot created by Google-owned firm Boston Dynamics is a formidable figure at 6ft 2in tall and weighing in at 330lb. The robot boasts 28 hydraulically actuated joints and stereo vision, and is one of the most advanced robots ever created. Atlas will also now carry an onboard 3.7-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, with the potential for one hour of 'mixed mission' operation that includes walking, standing, use of tools, and other movements. The upgraded Atlas is 75 percent new—only the lower legs and feet were carried over from the original design . Gill Pratt, of DARPA said: 'Atlas unplugged is the upgrade to allow it to run entirely on batteries. 'We have to cut the cord.' 'The new Atlas is 75% new, it has much more dexterity and is quieter, and stronger. 'The introduction of a battery and variable-pressure pump into Atlas poses a strategic challenge for teams,' said Pratt. 'The operator will be able to run the robot on a mid-pressure setting for most operations to save power, and then apply bursts of maximum pressure when additional force is needed.' During the finals, a series of events will be held to replicate disasters. 'The finals will be very hard.\\xa0We want them to be more like real disasters, the robots will have to do all these tasks in sequence with no human help. Given their identical hardware, the Atlas teams will have to differentiate themselves through software, control interfaces, and competition strategy. Other firms are already developing robots with 'friendly' personalities . Teams will have a few options on the selection of tasks they choose to attempt and the order they do them—and must manage time and battery life during their runs—but DARPA expects that the top-placing teams will complete all of the tasks. Teams are likely to keep their robots connected to fall arrestors during much of the remaining months of training as a safeguard against premature damage to the robot. DARPA demonstrated the new Atlas with a fall arrestor in place. 'Risk mitigation is part of the game,' Pratt said. 'It's up to the teams to decide what chances they're willing to take during training and risk falls and damage, but come the DRC Finals, the cords are cut.' The researchers even taught the robot to stand on one leg - recreating a key scene from the film in the process. The Atlas robot has already shown it can walk, jump and even drive a car . However, it's not just karate - Ian has another trick up his sleeve - software written by the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Interaction which allows him to drive a car. 'To achieve this level of maneuverability in robots, researchers at IHMC look toward nature,' the team say. 'Inspired by the speed of cheetahs, the endurance of horses, the maneuverability of monkeys, and the versatility of humans, IHMC researchers are on a quest to develop legged robots that are fast, efficient, and graceful, with the mobility required to access many of the same places that humans can.' At the US Government's Robo-Olympics, Ian came second, despite competing as a virtual software simulation. Despite his lack of limbs, the world's most innocuously named 'bot was able to walk, carry a fire hose and, most impressively, get in a car and drive it. The 'crane' stance, being held by Karate Kid\\xa0Daniel LaRusso (played by Ralph Maccio left) in the 1984 film inspired the latest movements of the Atlas robot. It demonstrates strong balancing skills and composure and showcases the agility of the Google-owned machine, said the firm . Atlas is a high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough terrain, Boston Dynamics said. 'Atlas can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift, carry, and manipulate the environment. In extremely challenging terrain, Atlas is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet, to pick its way through congested spaces. The Atlas robot has an articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder so it can 'see' where it is going. 'Articulated, sensate hands will enable Atlas to use tools designed for human use. Atlas includes 28 hydraulically-actuated degrees of freedom, two hands, arms, legs, feet and a torso. 'An articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder.' Atlas is powered from an off-board, electric power supply via a flexible tether - although a new version promises to remove this.\",\n",

Karen Davis, from Port Pirie in South Australia, notoriously flashed her K-cup breasts on Google Street View and was reported by police with disorderly behaviour. She handed herself into police voluntarily. However,\\xa0ABC News reports that\\xa0South Australian law professor Rick Sarre believed it should not result in charges or a court appearance and that the swab was unnecessary. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . ‘I think it's outrageous, but I know young juvenile offenders who have been questioned over certain things who have had the same thing happen to them,’ he said. 'That behaviour's being defended by the police commissioner, who says ''that's what happens these days''. ‘That doesn't surprise me because unfortunately that's the kind of law and order climate in which this Government has pushed us in the last dozen years.’ The 38-year-old was captured\\xa0streaking by a camera car for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. Police released a statement alleging the 38-year-old mother 'pursued' the Google car to make sure she was captured exposing herself, and that it was an illegal act. 'The woman’s actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals and the public expectation is that we take action,' said\\xa0Superintendent Scott Denny of Port Pirie police. 'Recently in Port Pirie we arrested a man for exposing himself in public - this incident is no different. 'It is not appropriate for anyone to expose themselves in public places. Our community should be able to expect a bit of decency.' In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Ms Davis, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at the controversy caused by her actions, claiming that 'flat-tittie chicks' are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Ms Davis had issues with her size-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I \\xa0always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.\",\n",

Two care home workers who left a mute dementia patient in agony after she fell on the floor, then lied about what had happened, have been jailed. Ethel Rider, 87, suffered a broken pelvis and was left ‘cowering’ in pain after falling from her bed. But even though the grandmother was in agony, her carers failed to seek medical help and simply lifted her back into bed. Because she is mute, Mrs Rider was unable to tell anyone what had happened. It was only 24 hours later that a nurse realised she was in agonising pain and called an ambulance. The injury occurred because one of her carers, Susan Logan, had tried to turn her by herself – against the proper procedure at the private home. But when asked what had happened, Logan and her supervisor, Lauren Gillies, lied, saying Mrs Rider had fallen out of bed. Yesterday both were beginning six-month prison sentences after a judge branded them ‘idle’, saying they had cut corners to give themselves longer breaks. Afterwards the pensioner’s family slammed the carers’ ‘disgusting’ betrayal and said they were pleased both had been jailed. The Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign has repeatedly highlighted examples of poor care in residential homes and on NHS wards. Mrs Rider, a retired factory worker, moved into the Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe, near Manchester, where staff working in pairs were meant to turn her in bed every two hours. But on May 19 last year, Logan, 59, was trying to turn Mrs Rider by herself when the pensioner fell out of bed. Bolton Crown Court heard how it may have been some time before the emergency alarm was called and Gillies, 25, arrived to find the grandmother in pain and on the floor. ‘She was left on the floor for 40 minutes,’ said Jonathan Turner, prosecuting. ‘She was then hoisted back into the bed. No ambulance was called and the story was devised between the two of them.’ The court heard how Mrs Rider, who now has the mental capacity of a baby, is mute and would have been unable to convey the pain of being hoisted back into bed with a broken pelvis. Care workers Lauren Gillies, 25 (left) and Susan Logan, 59, (right) have been jailed for six months each . Logan, of Radcliffe, and Gillies, of Ramsbottom, admitted wilful neglect. Judge Timothy Stead told them: ‘What you did between the two of you was outrageous. Your decisions have been described as stupid, but I would use a stronger word. They were criminally wrong.’ Mrs Rider’s daughter Julie Murphy, 52, from Radcliffe, said: ‘I am satisfied they have been jailed. What they did is disgusting.’ Four Seasons Health Care, which runs the home, said: ‘We are very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family as a result of the actions of the carers.’ A spokesman for the care home said they were 'very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family'\",\n",

A study of wildlife sites across four English counties has found that most are home to fewer species of bee today than they were in the past. It found that the expansion of farmland has actually been more damaging to Britain’s bee population than the concreting over of the countryside for housing. A Reading University researcher has said that bees prefer cities to fields (honey bees in Paris shown). The expansion of farmland has actually been damaging to bee population, according to the researcher. Wildlife sites in four English counties saw bee species decrease . For instance, heaths and meadows near Milton Keynes now boast more species of bee than sites in more rural areas. Reading University researcher Dr Deepa Senapathi believes intensive agriculture is to blame. Climate change could be disrupting the relationship between bees and plants. That's according to a study that said warmer springs can change the life cycles of bees, which can throw them out of sync with the plants they pollinate . The research is the first clear example of the potential for climate change to disrupt such critical relationships between species. The study, Potential Disruption of Pollination in a Sexually Deceptive Orchid by Climate Change, was carried out by the University of East Anglia (UEA) and was published in the journal Current Biology. While the gardens, parks and churchyards of towns and cities provide bees with a variety of plants to forage on and an extended flowering season, popular crops such as oilseed rape only bloom for a few weeks. She said: ‘While concreting over the countryside may appear to be bad news for nature, we’ve found that progressive urbanisation may be much less damaging than intensive agriculture. ‘Urban areas may benefit bees more than farmland by providing a wide variety of flowering plants, providing a cosmopolitan menu for insects from spring through to autumn. ‘Over the past century rural landscapes in Britain have become increasingly dominated by large expanses of monoculture - the growing of a single type of plant, which has helped boost crop production. ‘But without a mixture of habitat and food sources, rural areas can sometimes be little better than green deserts for biodiversity.' Scientists around the country are trying to work out why populations of bees and other insects are plummeting. Pesticides, climate change and disease may, like intensive farming, be playing a role. The latest research is published in the Royal Society journal Proceedings B.

At around 10.30pm on Sunday, Turkman Gate lived up to Delhi’s reputation as a city that has lost its soul. Two children, 13 and nine years old, stood wailing and begging bystanders as five local strongmen mercilessly beat their father to death over a traffic quarrel. Road rage claimed another life. No one in the crowd came forward. The police did not arrive from a chowki merely 50 metres away. You could tick every item on Delhi’s infamous check-list. When no one came to their father’s rescue, the hapless children ran to the cops, who asked them to call 100. By the time the police reached the spot, their father was lying in a pool of blood, and was declared dead on arrival at the Lok Nayak Hospital. The death of 40-year-old Shahnawaz has shaken the city. Murders are commonplace in the Capital, but a man being thrashed to death because his motorcycle grazed a car as bystanders watched in silence is a new low even by Delhi’s standards. Also, while Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi boasts about the new police motto “Shanti, Seva or Naya” and compares the force to the best-rated police departments across the globe, his men stood and watched Shahnawaz die without raising a finger. According to the Delhi Police, Shahnawaz was returning home from a family function with his two sons on a motorbike when it grazed a car near Turkman Gate in Daryaganj. Iron rods . The driver of the i20 car, identified as Shadab, got into a verbal spat with Shahnawaz. Shadab reportedly told Shahnawaz to move his bike as he was unable to manoeuvre his car. When Shahnawaz expressed his inability to do so due to heavy traffic, Shadab, along with Khalid Amin, another occupant of the car, started thrashing Shahnawaz with iron rods. Later, three other occupants of the car,\\xa0 Atif Lala, Mohammed Wasim, and another unidentified person, got out and joined them. Seeing their father being attacked so mercilessly, Fahad and his younger brother Kaif tried to hold back the accused, but were pushed aside. The boys then ran to the nearest barricade where two policemen were standing and begged them to help their father. ‘Dial 100’ The cops allegedly told them to dial 100. The children then ran to their grandmother's house nearby and said: “Abu ki bahar ladai ho gayi hai kuch logo ke saath (Dad is involved in a fight outside with some people)”. By the time the family reached the spot, it was already too late. Shahnawaz, bleeding heavily, was rushed to the nearby Lok Nayak Jaiprakash Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.

Heart-breaking:\\xa0Shahnawaz's mother breaks down in the Walled City after hearing the news of her son's death . Numb with grief:\\xa0Shahnawaz's devastated parents are supported by relatives . On Monday evening, almost 24 hours after the incident, Turkman Gate wore an uneasy calm. Throughout the day, Shahnawaz’s family members and relatives sat in protest on the road with his body. A crowd of 200 choked the entire stretch, causing traffic jams across central Delhi in places like New Delhi railway station, ITO, Mandi House and Connaught Place circle. Protesters held up a banner which had Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s picture along with those of the accused, demanding quick arrests. The victim’s relatives said police are trying to protect Amin. “Amin was the one who triggered the spat and started thrashing Shahnawaz. Police are clueless even after 12 hours of the incident,” Shahnawaz’s relative, Shahbuddin, told Mail Today. Delhi Police chief Bassi has assured that all accused will be arrested soon. “Mohammed Wasim has been arrested and the hunt for the remaining four is on,” he said, while briefing the media. Family of goons on a short fuse claims life . By Ankur Sharma in New Delhi . The arrogance and short temper of a family which has right connections with policemen and local politicians has snuffed out an innocent life. Residents of Delhi’s Turkman Gate, where 40-year-old Shahnawaz was thrashed to death on Sunday night, allege that main accused Khalid Amin alias Amin Pahalwan belongs to a family of goons, and all his 17 brothers are involved in illegal activities. In 2011, Amin was involved in a fight with former MLA Shoaib Iqbal. Three of the other accused in the Turkman Gate killing were also embroiled in that case. Relatives of the road rage victim point to the photos of some of the accused on an AAP hoarding in the area. However, a local AAP leader said they were not members of the party . Amin was initially a petty criminal. He was first arrested along with an associate in 1995 in an attempt to murder case from Seelampur area of North-East Delhi.\\xa0The rogue element of Chandni Mahal area started a construction business since 2010. “He has a construction and a handicraft business, but he is involved in various criminal cases. His brothers are also facing criminal charges,” a senior police officer said. Amin is allegedly involved in eight criminal cases - robbery, an attempt to murder, rioting and incidents of causing hurt. “He always carries a country-made pistol and a knife,” police sources said. Importantly, Amin enjoys good connections with the local police as his day-to-day work requires their co-operation. Drunk men thrash LS MP's son in another case . The Turkman Gate incident was not the only case of road rage reported in the Capital on Sunday. In another case, the son of a Lok Sabha MP was allegedly thrashed by three men in South Delhi’s South Extension area. The Delhi Police have arrested three accused in connection with the incident after registering a case under five IPC sections. According to police sources, the incident occurred when Ritu Raj, the son of Jahanabad MP Dr Arun Kumar, asked one of the accused to not park his Scooty in front of the gate of his residence. “Around 10pm, the police got a call from South Extension Part-2 that three-four men have beaten up a man. When the police reached the spot, they found the MP’s son lying on the road. A PCR vehicle took the victim to the nearest hospital. “After examining him, the doctors said Ritu Raj had dislocated his shoulder,” a police officer said. Sources said the police have arrested three accused. The main accused has been identified as Manohar Lal Batra. Ritu Raj also told the police that all the accused were drunk when they thrashed him. The accused also allegedly threatened to kill the victim’s sister if she intervened.\",\n",

And now developers at Open Garden have built Greenstone - a small egg-shaped gadget that acts like a beacon, or a booster, to help messages move around so-called wireless mesh networks more easily . FireChat launched last year and has been downloaded more than five million times. It takes advantage of a feature that launched in Apple’s iOS 7 called Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF).\\xa0Android has a similar feature that works over Bluetooth. MCF lets you send messages and photos even when a person has no signal by creating what is called a wireless mesh network. Apple added to Multipeer Connectivity framework (MCF) to iOS 7. It creates what’s called a wireless mesh network that connects phones to each other. Instead of sending messages using mobile or data signal, the features lets users send messages to people in close proximity that are in Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct range - up to around 30 feet (9 metres). It does this by creating a localised network in which each phone becomes a node and the data is passed between nodes. Apple uses the framework for its AirDrop feature, for example, which makes it easy to send files and data to other connected iPhone users. However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way - at around 200ft (61 metres) - and Greenstone has been designed to solve this. When a user opens the FireChat app, they pick a screen name to start sending messages. Within the app there are 'chatrooms' with 'Everyone' and 'Nearby' options. The former will search for all users, while the latter option applies to people within Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range who are also using the app. This is particularly useful when on a plane, or the underground. It can also be used to save money on data plans, for example. The app creates a localised network in which each phone becomes a node, and the data is passed between nodes. Apple . uses the framework for its AirDrop feature, for example, which makes it . easy to send files and data to other connected iPhone users. These messages are sent securely, so the individual nodes can’t read them. Users can also send messages anonymously to avoid snooping, for example, because data is sent from app usernames, as opposed to mobile numbers. Elsewhere, because the feature doesn’t use an internet connection, it can’t be infiltrated by hackers. The 'Everyone' Setting allows people to send information further, however. It does this by bringing all its nodes . onto one network and relaying messages from one node to another until . it reaches the final recipient. In FireChat (left) there are 'chatrooms' called Everyone and Nearby. The former searches for all users, while the latter applies to people within Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range.

However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way - at around 200ft (61 metres) - \\xa0and Greenstone has been designed to plus these gaps. Christophe Daligault, chief marketing officer at Open Garden told Daily Dot: 'The combination between [Greenstone] and the smartphones will enable a community, or a neighbourhood, or a hospital, or any other situation where they want resilient communication, even in the case of not having any connectivity.' It could also be placed in certain locations at music festivals, organised protests, football matches and other events where having large numbers of people can crash networks. Greenstone is still under development and only currently works with FireChat at a range of around 20ft (6 metres). Messages sit on Greenstone until another FireChat comes within range, and the device has a one-year battery life. It can additionally hold up to 1,000 of the most recent messages. Open Garden is now working with manufacturers to design and sell Greenstone and the timeframe will depend on these partnerships.\",\n",

Casteel has found a remarkable new way to capture images of toddlers at their most playful and pure as they dive down into the deep during their first swimming lesson. The pictures for his new book, Underwater Babies, reveal adorable babies as they explore the underwater world, chubby-cheeked, curious, mischievous, and playful, all captured in his up-close-and-personal signature style.

Oceanic: Nine-month-old Khyleigh takes like a duck to water as she swims towards the camera . His pictures are innovative and take on an air of excitement as the youngsters swim beneath the waves. Casteel says he was drawn to create his new book, Underwater Babies after hearing of the shocking statistics of the numbers of children that drown. Kids between one and four have the highest rates of drowning than any group in the nation. 'The book is a celebration of babies, but there's definitely a serious element to it,' Casteel told Today.com. 'A big reason I wanted to make this book is to promote the cause of water safety for babies. I just want to let people know about the benefits of these classes and that they are something to strongly consider.' He created the book by heading along to water safety classes for babies at swimming pools in ten different states. He photographed around 750 babies in schools across each of the states to create Underwater Babies, which will be released on April 7.

'I only had a limited window to really seize that moment in time because they can only go underwater just for a moment,' Casteel said. 'I could only take four or five pictures really quickly. Maybe the baby turned or there were bubbles or the instructor got in the way. I was never frustrated because that's the nature of it. You get what you get.' Apart from promoting his new 70-page book containing his creative pictures, Casteel said that he was eager to get the message across about water safety. He was spurred along after hearing a story about an 18-month old baby who drowned in a pool at a family reunion where over 40 people were present, yet the baby died after being left unattended. Floater: This 11-month-old named Warren is happy in the few moments he has beneath the pool's surface . Snapshot: Casteel often only had a second or two to capture the images of babies like Emerson who is 7 months old when they briefly went underwater . The babies in the pictures are being taught to 'self-rescue,' in which babies are taught to hold their breath underwater, kick their feet, turn over to float on their backs and rest until help arrives. The technique was pioneered in the late '60s by Harvey Barnett, who at 18 became determined to teach infants to swim after the drowning of a neighbor's child. His methods have spread around the world and are now taught in numerous clinics and imitated widely. Underwater Babies by Seth Casteel is published by Headline on 7th April at £11.99.

The striking circular structure is a rare manifestation of gravitational lensing predicted by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. Scroll down for video . Alma's image of the gravitationally lensed galaxy SDP.81. The bright orange central region of the ring - Alma's highest resolution observation ever - reveals the glowing dust in this distant galaxy . Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive galaxy or cluster of galaxies bends the light emitted from a more distant galaxy, forming a highly magnified, though much distorted image. In this particular case, the galaxy known as SDP.81 and an intervening galaxy line up so perfectly that the light from the more distant one forms a nearly complete circle as seen from Earth. Einstein's theory predicts that the gravitational effects of the nearer galaxy will bend the light of the more distant one. The Alma telescope in Chile was able to capture the effect in the highest resolution images ever taken by the observatory. In this particular case, the galaxy known as SDP.81 and an intervening galaxy line up so perfectly that the light from the more distant one forms a nearly complete circle as seen from Earth. Discovered by the Herschel Space Observatory, SDP.81 is an active star-forming galaxy nearly 12 billion light-years away, seen at a time when the universe was only 15 percent of its current age. It is being lensed by a massive foreground galaxy that is a comparatively nearby 4 billion light-years away. 'Gravitational lensing is used in astronomy to study the very distant, very early Universe because it gives even our best telescopes an impressive boost in power,' said Alma Deputy Program Scientist Catherine Vlahakis. 'With the astounding level of detail in these new Alma images, astronomers will now be able to reassemble the information contained in the distorted image we see as a ring and produce a reconstruction of the true image of the distant galaxy.' An AlmaHubble composite image of the gravitationally lensed galaxy SDP.81. The diffuse blue element at the center of the ring is from the intervening lensing galaxy, as seen with the Hubble Space Telescope . The highest resolution image of SDP.81 was made by observing the relatively bright light emitted by cosmic dust in the distant galaxy. This striking image reveals well-defined arcs in a pattern that hints at a more complete, nearly contiguous ring structure. Though this intriguing interplay of gravity and light in SDP.81 has been studied previously by other observatories, none has captured the remarkable details of the ring structure in such detail. 'The exquisite amount of information contained in the Alma images is incredibly important for our understanding of galaxies in the early universe,' said astronomer Jacqueline Hodge with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Va. 'Astronomers use sophisticated computer programs to reconstruct lensed galaxies' true appearance. 'This unravelling of the bending of light done by the gravitational lens will allow us to study the actual shape and internal motion of this distant galaxy much more clearly than has been possible until now.'

Some of the hens found at Wagner's Poultry Farm were ravaged and dying . Some looked as if they had only a few days left to live such was their condition . Eggs were still being produced at the farm despite the poorly hens . Activists said they found birds living in terrible conditions. Amazingly, two weeks earlier government health officials inspected the farm, but gave it the all clear. However, several hens were in such a bad state that they had to be removed from the cages by the activists as they were in desperate need of veterinary care. 'During multiple investigations in March, our rescue team discovered deformed, sick and dying hens, filthy conditions and immensely dangerous working conditions, which are now being investigated by Worksafe,'\\xa0Noah Hannibal president of Animal Liberation Victoria told Daily Mail Australia.

'Photos and video were taken of hens with eyeballs hanging out, with mangled beaks, and completely defeathered hens. 'Hens spend over a year in small wire cages, as is standard practice in the egg industry. When they are no longer 'profitable' they are sent to the slaughterhouse. 'Our rescue team found many hens in urgent need of veterinary attention, who were clearly not receiving any care.' But the owner of the 6000-bird farm that sells caged, free-range chicken and duck eggs has denied claims that the animals were not being cared for properly. Two dead hen carcases are just left on the floor of the caged chicken farm . Dirt and dust hang from the hen cages that look as if they haven't been cleaned for ages . Wagner’s Poultry is a family business that has been operating for over 50 years. ‘Wagner’s is regularly inspected by the Department of Primary Industries alongside a veterinary practitioner to ensure Wagner’s meets all regulatory requirements and adheres to the industries code of practice,’ the company said in a statement. ‘At no time has the industry regulator raised concerns with the animal husbandry practices on Wagner’s property. ‘Wagner’s Chicken Picken shed has been specifically designed to ensure that all our poultry is selected in a stress-free environment rather than being chased and caught in the paddock.’ Nothing to see here: One hen with a mangled beak looks forlornly out through its cage . Hundreds of hens stand in rows of cages as they lay eggs in pretty dire conditions . Dirty and emaciated hens stand in their cages with no room to move . The government department responsible for animal welfare in commercial facilities also confirmed two recent inspections did not find any breaches under animal cruelty laws. However, Mr Hannibal maintained that not only is the farm a hell hole for hens, it is also extremely unsafe for workers. 'Narrow and flimsy walkways next to the central cages drop directly into manure pits below,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'This presents a huge danger to any humans working in the shed who are at risk of falling down to the excrement pit a floor below - when they attempt to populate and depopulate the cages, or carry out the ‘daily inspection’ required by law.

In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the Coalition had spent five years ‘trying to lift people up’ by making work pay and encouraging responsibility. ‘Just because some people have disagreed with our policies, does not mean those policies are missing in moral content,’ he insisted. Scroll down for video . Trip with George: Prime Minister David Cameron visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton yesterday . Statement: In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the coalition had spent five years 'trying to lift people up' by making work pay and encouraging responsibility . His intervention came as another senior Tory, chief whip Michael Gove, claimed Christians in Britain were being dismissed with a combination of condescension and suspicion. Six weeks ago, the Church provoked a row with ministers by publishing an unprecedented guide to how the country’s 30million Christians should ‘approach the General Election’. Bishops insisted it was not targeted at any particular party, and criticised successive governments while calling for a ‘fresh moral vision’. But much of the 50-page document was widely interpreted as indirect criticism of the Coalition’s welfare policies, which include a £26,000-a-year cap on household benefits, a new universal credit designed to ensure people are always better off in work and tough sanctions to prevent people languishing on jobless benefits. The bishops complained that welfare claimants were ‘described in terms that imply they are undeserving, dependent and ought to be self-sufficient’. They insisted it was ‘game-playing … to claim that anyone who cares about the impact of austerity on the most vulnerable members of society is… careless about the extent of national indebtedness’. The Archbishop of Canterbury the Most Rev Justin Welby - pictured ahead of a service for the re-burial of Richard III at Leicester Cathedral last week - has seen the Church of England come under fire from the PM . Despite evidence that the best-off are paying more in tax than ever before, the bishops also complained that ‘the greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders’. Official Treasury figures suggest that the richest 10 per cent of households are contributing most to deficit reduction. Archbishop of York John Sentamu blamed welfare cuts and 'poverty wages' for rising inequality . Speaking to Premier Christianity magazine, Mr Cameron said the ‘values of the Christian faith are the values on which our nation was built’. ‘I’m an unapologetic supporter of the role of faith in this country. And for me, the key point is this: the values of Easter and the Christian religion – compassion, forgiveness, kindness, hard work and responsibility – are values that we can all celebrate and share,’ he added. Mr Cameron conceded he was not a model Christian and was ‘a bit hazy on the finer points of our faith’. ‘But even so, in the toughest of times, my faith has helped me move on and drive forward. It also gives me a gentle reminder every once in a while about what really matters and how to be a better person, father and citizen,’ he added. The Prime Minister said he had attempted to ‘banish the notion that being in government means you can somehow wave a magic wand and solve all the world’s problems’, and instead it was about ‘the right judgement… based on clear values and beliefs’. He said the Government had inherited ‘exceptional pressure on the national finances’ from Labour, adding: ‘I am proud that despite the pressure on public spending, we made clear choices to help the poorest paid and most vulnerable in society. ‘We have increased NHS spending, despite the overriding need to deal with the deficit. We also raised the threshold of income tax to lift the poorest paid out of income tax altogether. ‘More fundamentally, the core of our recovery programme – dealing with the deficit to restore confidence in our economy – is based on enduring ideas and principles: hard work, fair play, rewarding people for doing the right thing, and securing a better future for our children.’ Writing in The Spectator magazine today, Mr Gove said that the popular image of Christianity was at odds with the reality of churches across the country, which daily offered ‘thousands of quiet kindnesses’ to those most in need. ‘To call yourself a Christian in contemporary Britain is to invite pity, condescension or cool dismissal.’ Nick Clegg is on course to lose his seat to Labour, a poll suggested yesterday.

Its deputy chairman claims children are being exposed to ‘propaganda’ from Brussels in a bid to ‘catch them young’. Suzanne Evans said: ‘It’s everything there from colouring-in books on the Common Agricultural Policy for primary schoolchildren right up to research projects at university level. ‘The amount of money that the EU is putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous. 'Overall the EU has an advertising budget that is larger than Coca-Cola.’ It is thought the Lib Dems would demand 16 and 17-year-olds are given a say in any EU referendum as part of a post-election coalition deal.\",\n",

This image shows the Johnson Reef on 25 February 2014, which has seen land added drastically over the last three years. A Chinese vessel is seen at the top . The large expanses of sand and concrete - the latest being Johnson Reef - are being built among the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. China is creating the area by using dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea, and then dumping it on subermeged coral reefs to make islands, Ethan Rosen - a geopolitical researcher in China -\\xa0explained. And experts have told MailOnline that the activities could be hugely damaging to local ecosystems. China has supposedly been carrying out the land reclamation in order to build airstrips and other structures in the region. Five islands in total have been built in this way, and two more are in development. Richard Dodge of the Nova Southeastern University Oceanographic Center, said: 'The activities described would appear to clearly both be greatly exceeding corals and coral reefs’ ability to cope and survive the excess sediments and turbidity.' He said that as the reefs were being covered by cement and landfill, this constituted 'outright destruction' of the buried coral reefs and associated habitats. 'Coral reefs are extremely globally and locally valuable both for the biodiversity and ecosystem they create but also for the tremendous services they provide in terms of food supply, cultural heritage, erosion prevention, recreation, tourism, and habitat for myriad other organisms,' he continued. 'Coral reefs worldwide are under extreme threat from changing climate and from local sources of land based pollution, over fishing, and coastal construction. 'The activities described would appear to represent an additional and severe threat to coral reef ecosystem health and sustainability.' Robert Nicholls, a\\xa0Professor of Coastal Engineering at the University of Southampton, added: 'It is clearly destroying [coral reefs] at the local scale of the land claim and the environment. 'In the bigger scheme of things it is harder to be precise as these are small areas in a large area of reef.' Experts have told MailOnline that the activities could be hugely damaging to local ecosystems. China has supposedly been carrying out the land reclamation in order to build airstrips and other structures in the region. The extent of how much damage is being done is seen in this image . This photo released by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, shows what the Johnson Reef looked like on 28 February 2013. A Chinese-made structure stands on the Johnson Reef, called Mabini by the Philippines and Chigua by China, in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea . This photo, taken on 13 March 2012, shows what the Johnson Reef looked like before China started to build there. The Philippines has protested China's reclamation of land in the disputed reef in the South China Sea that can be used to build an airstrip or an offshore military base in the increasingly volatile region . Yesterday, the commander of the US Pacific Fleet - Admiral Harry Harris Jr - warned that the constructions were 'increasing regional tensions and the potential for miscalculation.' 'China is building artificial land by pumping sand on to live coral reefs - some of them submerged - and paving over them with concrete. China has now created over 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) of artificial landmass,' he said. Harris said the region is known for its beautiful natural islands, but 'in sharp contrast, China is creating a great wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers over the course of months.' China claims virtually all of the South China Sea, but the Philippines and other countries which have territorial disputes with China in the busy sea have been particularly concerned by the land reclamation projects. These have turned a number of previously submerged reefs in the Spratlys archipelago into artificial islands with buildings, runways and wharves. The islands could be used for military and other facilities to bolster China's territorial claims. The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. Several south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. Beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. Taiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. Vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. In 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. There were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. In 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. The\\xa0Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. Upon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. Later, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake. China is creating the area by using dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea, and then dump it on subermeged reefs to make islands, Ethan Rosen - a geopolitical researcher in China - explained. Shown is an image of a dredging vessel in San Francisco, demonstrating how land can be moved from underwater . Harris said the pace of China's construction of artificial islands 'raises serious questions about Chinese intentions.' He said the US continues to urge all claimants to conform to the 2002 China-ASEAN Declaration of Conduct, in which the parties committed to 'exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability.' 'How China proceeds will be a key indicator of whether the region is heading toward confrontation or cooperation,' he said. The US says it has a national interest in the peaceful resolution of the disputes in a region crucial for world trade. China says its territorial claims have a historical basis and objects to what it considers US meddling.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"There are few things more beautiful - or terrifying - than the menacing flash of lightning bolts within a volcanic ash cloud. The latests picture, captured by an amateur photographer as the Colima volcano in Mexico spews out a plume of ash and lava, reveals the raw power of a volcanic eruption. Hernando Rivera Cervantes took the pictures as local authorities warned those living around the volcano, which is also known as the Fire volcano, to prepare for a possible evacuation. Lightning strikes inside the enormous ash cloud thrown into the air by the Colima volcano (above) in Mexico . The 12,400 feet (3,800 metre) high volcano, which first erupted in 1576, is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico. Mr Cervantes spent eight hours watching the volcano as it threw ash up to 1.8 miles (three kilometres) into the atmosphere before managing to capture the rare picture. He said: 'I waited for eight hours, knowing something was going to happen. When the lightning arrived it was magical. An unforgettable experience.' These blots of lightning are thought to occur due to the build up of electric charge in the ash cloud as the particles rub against each other. Just like in a thunder cloud, this charge eventually builds up until it seeks a path through to the ground as lightning. This sequence of images captured by photographer\\xa0Hernando Rivera Cervantes show the lightning flashes as the Colima volcano erupted . Mr Cervantes also managed to capture this night-time image above of lava spilling from the erupting volcano . Small volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years have been protecting the Earth from global warming, according to a recent study. Scientists have confirmed that droplets of sulphur-rich aerosols spewed into the upper atmosphere by volcanoes have been reflecting sunlight away from the Earth. Until recently it was thought that only particularly large eruptions had any noticeable affect on the climate. However, a study published earlier this year has confirmed results from the end of last year that showed these small eruptions can have an accumulative impact on global temperature. This could have helped decrease the global temperatures by between 0.05°C to 0.12°C over the past 15 years. Earlier this month scientists discovered that it is this lightning that is responsible for making the glass spheres that can appear in volcanic rocks. They found that the intense heat generated by the lightning bolts causes the ash to melt into spherules of smooth glass. A bolt of volcanic lighting can heat the surrounding air to more than 3,000°C, according to the researchers from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Dr Kimberly Genareau, a volcanologist at the University of Alabama, said their findings\\xa0suggested that the role lightning plays in volcanic eruptions may be under reported. Writing in the journal Geology, she said: 'We refer to this new morphological classification of ash grains as lightning-induced volcanic spherules (LIVS). 'Observation of LIVS in tephras (volcanic rocks) will provide evidence of lightning occurrence during eruptions where lightning was not directly observed or documented.' The Colima volcano is actually one of three volcanic domes that make up the Colima Volcanic complex in the Mexican state of Colima, 301 miles west of Mexico City. It has erupted around 40 times since its first recorded activity in 1576. There are now around 300,000 people living in it shadow. The volcano has a history of large and explosive eruptions, which has meant it is also one of the most studied volcanoes in Mexico. Although lightning in volcanic ash clouds has been observed for a long time, scientists have only recently begun to understand what causes it. The Colima volcano is regarded as one of the most dangerous in Mexico due to its large explosive eruptions . Mr Cervantes (shown above) spent eight hours waiting to capture his stunning images of the Colima volcano . Getting close enough to an erupting volcano is dangerous, so scientists at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich recreated volcanic lightning in a lab. In 2013 they suspended volcanic ash gathered from sites around the world in a chamber filled with argon gas, forcing the concoction through a narrow tube. They found that the movement of ash particles against each other as they go from the compressed environment under the Earth's surface into the atmosphere during an eruption causes a built of up static charge. When the ash reaches the atmosphere, the energy is discharged as lightning bolts.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"As someone who suffers from computer eye strain, I was alarmed to discover that prolonged exposure to gadgets such as iPhones and iPads can cause irreversible damage to the eyes. A Spanish expert, Dr Celia Sanchez-Ramos, has found the LED screens found in most electronic devices can harm the retina - the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye - and may even lead to partial blindness. Research has already shown that the intense levels of 'blue light' emitted from modern gadgets can cause a variety of health complaints, ranging from sleeping and eating problems to headaches and even cancer. Scroll down for video . LED screens found in most electronic devices such as iPhones and tablets can harm the retina - the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye - and may even lead to partial blindness, a doctor has warned . Now, Dr Sanchez-Ramos has discovered that it can also permanently damage the retina. In extreme cases, she says, it may even lead to macular degeneration, which causes dark patches to appear in the centre of the field of vision. According to Dr Sanchez-Ramos, modern LED screens, produced from about 2007 onwards, emit up to five times as much blue light as older technology. This matches my own experience, in which pre-2007 screens tend not to cause discomfort. The average adult now spends up to eight-and-a-half hours in front of a screen every day, and it is not uncommon to be exposed to multiple screens at once. For these reasons, says Dr Sanchez-Ramos, who is based at Complutense University in Madrid, the majority of people are likely to be in the danger zone. Children and the elderly are most at risk on account of their delicate eyes, as well as 'digital workers' and those - like me - who are especially sensitive to blue light. Dr Sanchez-Ramos (pictured) said: 'Never before in human history have we exposed our eyes to light that is so intense, for such long periods, from such an early age' 'Never before in human history have we exposed our eyes to light that is so intense, for such long periods, from such an early age,' she says. 'People who suffer from eye strain are like the canaries in the mineshaft, as they are aware of the damage being done. But it can affect anybody.' The damage, she explains, starts when the photoreceptors - types of neurone found in the retina that convert light into information - begin to die out due to the prolonged saturation of blue light. This puts strain on other parts of the eye, leading to increasing levels of inflammation, discomfort and pain. Eventually, the concentration of blue light in the centre of the retina, an area known as the macula, may cause it to be permanently damaged, leading to visual disorders. However the problem can be remedied by using special screen filters or glasses designed to block blue light, which are available through opticians. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney, clinical adviser at the College of Optometrists, says: 'It has been proven that intense exposure to blue light kills cells in the retina, and it is a perfectly reasonable possibility that it can cause macular degeneration over a period of time. 'More research is needed to prove it to the scientific standard. We need to conduct studies on a large number of people over a long period of time. 'But the proposal is of great interest.' Dr Sanchez-Ramos carried out experiments at the University of Madrid in which human retinal cells, taken from volunteers, were exposed to cycles of LED light of different intensities. She found that exposure to intense blue light caused apoptosis, or cell death. However this was reduced by 83 per cent when a special protective filter was placed between the cells and the light. Based on this research, she designed a screen filter called ' Reticare ', which converts harmful blue light to a gentler frequency more akin to sunshine. Dr Sanchez-Ramos found that exposure to intense blue light caused cell death in the eye. However this was reduced by 83 per cent when a special protective filter was placed between the cells and the light . Her findings prompted her to design a screen filter called ' Reticare ', which converts harmful blue light to a gentler frequency more akin to sunshine . Other treatments are also available. In 2013, Barnard Levit optometrists in London, who are specialists in the field, tested my eyes using a machine called a Colorimeter. Following this, they designed a pair of glasses with a blue tint, which blocked the most harmful part of the colour spectrum. The harmful effects of exposure to gadgets is linked to the high levels of 'blue light', also known as 'short wavelength light', that is emitted by modern screens. According to researchers at Harvard Medical School , 'not all colours of light have the same effect'. In particular, blue wavelengths, which are emitted by most electronic devices produced from 2007 onwards, have been shown to have 'adverse health effects'. Modern LED screens emit up to five times as much blue light as older technology. Researchers have found that using an electronic gadget with a backlit display for just two hours can affect the production of melatonin - the chemical that controls our body clock - and cause sleep problems, particularly in teenagers. A study at Chicago's Northwestern University revealed that prolonged exposure to blue light stimulated the sensation of hunger, even directly after meals, making it a contributor to weight gain and obesity. And experts at the University of Connecticut found a link between cancer and the use of gadgets that emit blue light in the evenings and by night. In addition, Dr Sanchez-Ramos has found that exposure to blue light can damage the retina causing macular degeration, or partial blindness. Children and young adults are at greater risk, as they lack the natural protection against blue light that the human eye naturally acquires. The effects can be reduced by the use of protective filters or spectacles. Prior to this, I had been unable to use iPhones, iPads and other gadgets with LED screens without shooting pain in my eyes, dizziness and nausea. This condition is known as Meares-Irlen syndrome or 'visual stress'. It is thought to be caused by hypersensitivity to particular frequencies of light, whether blue, red or green. In response, the visual cortex - the part of the brain responsible for processing visual information - generates too much electrical activity. This spills over into different areas of the brain, causing a variety of symptoms. About 10 per cent of people with dyslexia are thought to have visual stress. It can also be found in those with autism, ADHD, migraine, photo-sensitive epilepsy and multiple sclerosis, as well as stroke victims. Unusually for a sufferer of the condition, I have none of the related conditions listed above. When I used the blue glasses, however, I found that my eye pain, dizziness and nausea all but disappeared when using LED screens. I later discovered the glasses did not work with every type of screen, possibly because some emit different frequencies of harmful light. When I road-tested one of Dr Sanchez-Ramos' filters, I found my symptoms were reduced significantly on all devices, though the blue spectacles were more effective with certain screens. Dr Sanchez-Ramos says the use of LED screens has become so ubiquitous in such a short period of time that in 20 years' time, severe eye problems could become widespread. She and her colleagues are lobbying Apple, Samsung and other technology manufacturers to make their screens friendlier to the eye, meaning that no protective filters would be needed. This, she says, is an uphill struggle because super-bright screens make more of an impact on the customer, which encourages sales. She has also been putting pressure on various European governments, on both a national and regional level. As a result, a number of Spanish local authorities have ruled that all schools under their jurisdiction must use protective screen filters. Reticare filters are now available online and cost between €12.95 and €49, depending on the size of the screen.\",\n",

The model and host Drew Carey both gasped after she revealed the true price of the Hyundai Sonata SE before Andrea had finished guessing. Speaking to the New York Daily News, she described how after the blunder she broke down in tears and 'wanted to go in a wormhole and disappear.'

She admitted that her body moved quicker than her brain . Model Manuela Arbelaez, left, can't hid her embarassment as contestant Andrea, right, celebrates her win . She added: 'I knew there was no way to fix it. I went to this dark place, and I thought I'd get fired or it would be taken out of my paycheck.' Producers however decided not to punish her, and said there was nothing to worry about during the commercial break. She added that host Carey was 'understanding and supportive' and told her he thought it was the 'funniest thing ever.' ''I'm not in trouble :) phew!,' she wrote on Twitter yesterday. She noted that there have been many model mishaps over the show's 43 seasons. 'There was an occasion when a girl crashed a car into Door 3 and another gave away a trip to Disneyland,' Arbelaez recalled. 'There have been small things like that over the years, but I think my mistake was the most expensive in the history of the show.' However Arbelaez is still mortified by what happened, telling the Daily News: 'I'm a perfectionist. I'm very hard on myself. I do things right,' she said. 'I've never made a mistake in those six years. And of course\\xa0the one mistake I make, it's the biggest mistake in 'Price is Right' history.' 'I probably would've died if that happened within the first year of me working on the show. In a weird way, I'm kind of glad it happened now.'

Manuela just gave you a car! The game is over, folks.' Arbelaez joined the regular rotation of five models on The Price Is Right in April, 2009. In her six-year career, she says this is her first mistake . Despite the blunder, the Colombian said the producers and host were 'supportive and understanding' While Andrea jumps for joy, poor Manuela, 26 didn't know where to hid and she was eventually consoled by both Carey and the delighted contestant. Arbelaez later tweeted about her embarrassment at the heart-warming TV moment. 'I don't usually give expensive gifts, but when I do is a $21,960 CAR,' she tweeted, along with a clip from the show of her looking sheepish.

They're newlyweds settling down in their dream home, and this weekend it was reported that George and Amal Clooney have submitted plans to improve their £10million Berkshire mansion - which include the addition of a 12-seater cinema. While this may seem extravagant, according to industry experts, a cinema room is now an 'expected' luxury in properties worth over £10million. Robert Osborn, co-founding director of top luxury property developer\\xa0Consero London  explained: 'Home cinemas are a growing requirement, particularly for brand new or newly refurbished properties.' 'At the high level, media rooms are a valuable use of space and are expected, particularly in homes priced above £10 million. We also often include pantries or bars as an addition to support the media room.' As extravagant as it may seem, home cinemas are often a clever investment as they make use of low value space in the dark basement. Property insider, Ben Hubbard, an asset manager at OracleAMG explains: 'Cinemas are often situated in the basement of a dwelling because there is no need for natural light.' Ben estimates that cinemas can cost anything from a few thousand to £100,000 to kit out and says: 'Home cinemas can vary from a converted surplus bedroom within an average sized dwelling to a 30-seater theatre in the basement of a much larger home. 'There's a vast difference in the set-up costs depending on how far you want to go,' he said. Ben believes that the home cinema trend is growing, and having a dedicated cinema room is becoming 'important' in high-end properties. But does it ever reap financial rewards when it comes to selling? 'If one was to spend fortunes investing in a cinema equipment for an average sized family home - the chances are it will not add any value to the house as a majority of the purchasers will have different uses for that room,' Ben said.

'At the other end of the scale the more space the dwelling has the more likely you’re going to expect to see a cinema room and therefore the more value it will add. Generally though it adds  saleability factor rather than actual value. 'Set-ups can range from large plasma TVs with off-the-shelf surround sound systems in a darkened rooms to tiered theatres with cinema quality digital projectors. 'High-end cinemas will have been constructed to consider the rest of the house and can be soundproofed to prevent noise problems occurring elsewhere, which also increases the cost.'

Police arrested 12 protesters Thursday when they tried to block trucks heading to the peak of Mauna Kea where one of the world's largest telescopes is being built. While the Native Hawaiian groups do not oppose the Thirty Meter Telescope itself, they disagree with the location of the construction on Mauna Kea - the highest point in the state which is considered a home of deities. About 300 people took part in the demonstration and those who were arrested were released after they each posted a $250 bail. Scroll down for video . Department of Land and Natural Resources officers arrest a Thirty Meter Telescope protester at the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hilo, Hawaii on Thursday . Thirty Meter Telescope protesters chant after being arrested from the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea . Native Hawaiians believe the site where the telescope is being assembled is sacred because it is where their creation story begins, said Kealoha Pisciotta, an opponent of the telescope project. And scientists believe the site is ideal location for one of the world's largest telescopes because of its remote and sheltered position, nestled in the crater of a dormant volcano. 'It is the burial grounds of some of our most sacred and revered ancestors,' said she said. 'It is a place where we go for sanctuary and release from the world around us, and it is also the home of our god.' All of the highest points in the islands are considered the home of deities, according to Pisciotta. 'I wouldn't consider it civil disobedience. We consider it civil assistance,' protestor Kahookahi Kanuha said reports Hawaii News Now.\\xa0'We were attempting to assist the authorities in upholding the law. 'And those who are being disobedient to the law are those with TMT, who are continuing to break the regulations of developing on conservational land.' After the vehicles were allowed to pass, about 40 to 50 people began following the trucks, which moved slowly because of their heavy loads. Protesters are preventing construction of a giant telescope near the summit of a mountain held sacred by Native Hawaiians. Some consider the $1.4 billion Thirty Meter Telescope project as desecrating the Big Island's Mauna Kea (on Monday protesters formed a road block outside the Mauna Kea visitors center) Department of Land and Natural Resources officers lead Thirty Meter Telescope protesters from the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea on Thursday . Work got underway after protesters were arrested and their path was cleared to the summit, Sandra Dawson, a spokeswoman for the project, said in an email to The Associated Press. Police said they warned protesters after an incident Monday that anyone who blocked the road would be arrested. On Monday, more than 50 protesters formed a roadblock Monday that stopped about 15 vehicles carrying workers up Mauna Kea, causing workers to wait more than eight hours before making their way down the mountain. 'We regret that police action had to be taken to enable our legal access to the project site,' Thirty Meter Telescope project manager Gary Sanders said in a statement relating to Thursday's arrests. Opponents who question whether land appraisals were done correctly and whether Native Hawaiian groups had been consulted have tried to prevent the construction of the telescope. A Department of Land and Natural Resources officer, center left, comforts a Thirty Meter Telescope protester on the summit . Protests also disrupted a groundbreaking and Hawaiian blessing ceremony last year, but no one was arrested. In fact, some protesters who yelled during the ceremony later apologized to event organizers and helped put away chairs, Pisciotta said. 'We said aloha to each other, and we hugged,' she said. University of Hawaii spokesman Dan Meisenzahl said in a telephone interview that the university is saddened about the arrests, but that access to site must be maintained. 'If the university had a heart, it would be broken right now,' he said about Thursday's arrests. However, 'we have to make sure the road is safe for whoever wants to be there.' The university sub-leases the land atop Mauna Kea for the telescope project, and it has always maintained that protesters would have free access to the site as long as they were not breaking any laws, he said. Meisenzahl said he was not certain why the arrests were made. The observatory is expected to be operational by 2024, the same year a 39-meter telescope is expected to be completed in Chile.\",\n",

According to the spokeswoman for the federal receiver, who controls California prison medical care, the surgery could cost taxpayers as much as $100,000. U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco ruled that denying sex reassignment surgery to 51-year-old Michelle-Lael Norsworthy violates her constitutional rights. Right to be a woman: \\xa0U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco ruled that denying sex reassignment surgery to  Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, 51, \\xa0pictured last year, violates her constitutional rights . Her birth name is Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy. Norsworthy has been in prison since 1987, serving a life sentence for second-degree murder. She has twice delayed her scheduled parole hearings in recent months. The ruling says it would be the second time nationwide that such a surgery has been performed on an inmate, an apparent reference to an inmate who castrated himself in Texas then was given the surgery out of necessity. Norsworthy has lived as a woman since the 1990s and has what Tigar termed severe gender dysphoria. 'The weight of the evidence demonstrates that for Norsworthy, the only adequate medical treatment for her gender dysphoria is SRS,' Tigar wrote, referring to sex reassignment surgery. He found that the decision by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to deny the procedure was medically unacceptable under the circumstances. Corrections officials said they are considering whether to appeal the ruling. Attorneys for Norsworthy did immediately comment. Paid surgery: Michelle-Lael Norsworthy has been living as a woman since the 1990s and her birth name is Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy. 'This would be a first for California, said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal receiver who controls California prison medical care. The cost to taxpayers for such surgery is uncertain, she said. 'It's several tens of thousands of dollars, possibly close to $100,000, depending on the circumstances. But It's hard to estimate,' Hayhoe said. Corrections officials, in previous court filings, argued that Norsworthy has received proper medical and mental health care for more than 15 years and is in no immediate medical danger if the surgery is not performed. Her care has included counseling, mental health treatment and hormone therapy that the department said 'has changed her physical appearance and voice to that of a woman' while helping her find her gender identity. That care is consistent with what other judges nationwide have found to be appropriate for transgender inmates, the department said. She currently is housed at Mule Creek State Prison, an all-male prison in Ione, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento. The sex change surgery will prompt practical problems, the department said. The department also said keeping Norsworthy in a men's prison could invite violence, including possible assault and rape. But she could also face danger at a women's prison — or pose a threat herself — because she had a history of domestic violence before her murder conviction, the department said. Possible danger of rape: She currently is housed at Mule Creek State Prison, an all-male prison in Ione, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento and there are fears she may be raped when becoming a woman .\",\n",

Mother-of-three Danielle Davis, 24, refused a termination when a routine scan showed her baby had a cyst on the brain. But when Daisy was born, Ms Davis and her partner Andrew Smith, 31, were told she had the rare disorder Anophthalmia, meaning she had no eyes. The condition is incurable, and so while Daisy can be fitted with glass eyes as she gets older, she will never be able to see. Danielle Davis, 24, has told of her heartbreak as her daughter Daisy, now eight weeks old, was born without any eyes . Daisy suffers from Anopthalmia, a rare condition which means 'lack of eyes'. Daisy will never be able to see, but some children with the disease have prosthetic eyes fitted for cosmetic reasons . Ms Davis refused a termination when a scan revealed a brain cyst, and says she 'has no regrets'. Daisy is now at home enjoying time with her mother Danielle, father Andrew, 31, and siblings Logan, six, and Tyler, four . Ms Davis, a care worker from Cwmbran, South Wales, said: 'It was a shock - we had never heard of it before\\xa0and neither had any of our friends or family. 'People didn't really know what to say when we told them. 'But she is our gorgeous baby and we have no regrets about turning down a termination. 'We want to give Daisy as normal a life as possible and give her the same opportunities as other children.' Anophthalmia is a rare disease in which a baby is born with no eyes. It develops during pregnancy, and affects around one in 10,000 births in the UK. There is sadly no cure. Ms Davis said:\\xa0'The cyst showed up on the 21-week scan and naturally, we were worried about it. Anophthalmia means an absence of the eye. A\\xa0child may be born with one, or both eyes, missing from the eye socket. The rare disorder develops during pregnancy and can be associated with other birth defects. The condition may be caused by genetic mutations and abnormal chromosomes. Researchers also believe that environmental factors, such as exposure to X-rays, chemicals, drugs, pesticides, toxins, radiation, or viruses, increase the risk of anophthalmia, but research is not conclusive. Unfortunately, there is no treatment that will restore vision in children affected by Anophthalmia. Children will need to undergo repeated hospital visits and many have prosthetic eyes to ensure that the bone and soft tissue around the eye socket grows properly and to improve appearance. Source: The Micro and Anopthalmic Children's Society . 'But none of the doctors said our baby could be born blind. 'Everyone has been really supportive and I can't thank the doctors and midwives enough for all of their help.' Daisy, now eight weeks old, is settling in at home with her siblings Logan, six, and Tyler, four. She will be admitted to the Great Ormond Street Hospital later this month for an operation to fit glass eyes. They will be replaced when she is 18-months-old with painted eyes that will look more natural. Her parents are now planning a 12,000 ft skydive to raise funds for the charity RNIB that supports people with sight loss. The couple also want to raise awareness of the condition. Ms Davis said: 'I hope that by raising awareness other parents to be won't experience the same shock that we did if their child has the condition.' The news comes after MailOnline reported on the story of baby Richie, who was also born without eyes, in January. Staff at Arizona's Banner Desert Medical Center initially thought  Richie's face was swollen at birth. But they were stunned to discover the reason his eyelids would not open was because he had anolpthalmia. Richie’s mother Kelly Lopez, from Mesa, Arizona, is optimistic that science will progress enough to help Richie see in his lifetime. Baby Richie Lopez was born with Anopthalmia in January. Doctors initially thought his face was just swollen .\",\n",

Police went to a home on March 26 in Balch Springs, Texas, to do a welfare check and were told by residents that a two-year-old child had died and a 'rising ceremony' performed, according to CBS. The ceremony was an attempt to resurrect the child, police claimed, and took place on March 22. Police went to a home on March 26 in Balch Springs, Texas, (pictured) to do a wellness check and were told that a two-year-old child had died and the body returned to Mexico. Police were now investigating . Lt Mark Maret told CBS: 'We don’t know if this was to try and resurrect the spirit of the child and we don’t know if this was to try and resurrect the child themselves or what exactly that service or ceremony encompasses.' The child's parents took the body to Mexico the following day. A phone number for the single-story home had been disconnected. A neighbor told Daily Mail Online on Friday that five children under the age of ten, both boys and girls, were also living at the home and had been taken away by Child Protective Services. Joy Donaldson said that she once complained to the woman who lived at the home about two of the boys, who had been bothering her dogs. The woman, whose name she did not know, told her that the children did not know any better 'because they had been taken off the streets of Mexico'. A second neighbor, Jean Turnipseed, told Daily Mail Online on Friday that she had heard  that church services were taking place at the home on Saturdays and Sunday nights, where people were being charged at the door. Unconfirmed reports have suggested that the two-year-old boy, whose name is unknown and who neighbors had not seen, may have died either of starvation or of a fall from a chair last week. Emergency services do not appear to have called until police received an anonymous tip four days later. Multiple calls to the Balch Springs Sheriff's Department went unanswered on Friday. Police refused to release names but an investigation is underway involving both state and federal authorities. According to public records, a branch of the Iglesia Internacional Jesus Es El Rey Church is associated with the home. Calls to church representatives went unanswered on Friday.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Her neighbour’s leylandii hedge stands 40ft tall and, says Audrey Alexander, has left parts of her garden in deep shade. What’s more, it now seems likely to remain that way. Despite a 35-year fight to get the trees cut down to size, the council has ruled they can stay. It is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of Mrs Alexander’s family. It kicked off 35 years ago when Mrs Alexander’s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii. A row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge (pictured) has finally come to and end after 35 years . The battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour's massive hedge . Then, 23 years ago, single mother Mrs Alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour Jeanette Robinson to trim the hedge. She claims Mrs Robinson refused and declared: ‘I would rather move than touch these trees.’ The dispute rumbled on, with Mrs Alexander, 54, claiming that the trees knocked £20,000 off the value of her property. She sensed an opportunity, however, with the passing of the High Hedge Act in Scotland in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases. Stirling Council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay, despite claims it has knocked £20,000 off the value of neighbour Audrey Alexander's house (pictured) The situation came to a head in 2008, when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour's garden shed . Audrey Alexander (pictured) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches . But her council has ruled that Mrs Robinson can keep the hedge, although it has to be cut to 20ft. Mrs Alexander said the ruling made ‘no difference’. The High Hedge Act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden. Complainants and the hedge's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort. Because the effect the hedge has is not always clear, disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached. The local authority can either issue a high hedge notice, which orders owners to cut the hedge back, or decide not to act. The local authority cannot make any orders about the roots of the hedge. She added: ‘The whole situation is appalling – the legislation is about giving people the right to sunlight. ‘It’s a disgrace and I feel extremely let down.’ The neighbour refused to comment. Mrs Alexander’s only option is the courts which she cannot afford to do. Over the years she had used the mediation services of Stirling District Council to try to resolve the issue. The situation came to a head in 2008, when she claims a 65ft section of hedge fell, demolishing a neighbour’s garden shed. Following the introduction of the High Hedge Act, Stirling Council found in her favour but the neighbour appealed and won the 20ft ruling. Dr Colin Watson, of Scothedge, a group which demands the end of ‘high hedge tyranny’, said that the council’s decision was ‘pretty crazy’. A council spokesman said the decision was made ‘after carrying out a site inspection and considering all the evidence’. Mrs Alexander said her aunt, now 87, had moved to France to enjoy ‘sunshine and gardening’. Ms Alexander called in Stirling District Council to try to solve the quarrel, but no solution could be found and the feud continued . The council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft, a height which Ms Alexander claims will still block most of her sunlight .\",\n",

The Planetary Society analysed the feasibility and cost of a crewed mission to orbit the Martian moon Phobos in 2033, leading up to a crewed landing on the Red Planet in 2039. It concluded that such a plan could indeed fit within NASA's human space exploration budget - but that politics is holding the decision back. Scroll down for video . The Planetary Society says Nasa can afford a crewed mission to orbit the Martian moon Phobos in 2033, leading up to a crewed landing on the Red Planet in 2039 . The Phobos orbital mission would last approximately 30 months, with nine months of travel each way and 12 months in orbit, the panelists said. Crewmembers would be able to study Phobos and Deimos, Mars' other moon, and potentially teleoperate rovers on the Martian surface. The panel said the current plan would use an Orion spacecraft to move crewmembers from Earth into orbit and back down. 'We believe we now have an example of a long-term, cost-constrained, executable humans-to-Mars program,' Scott Hubbard, a professor in the Stanford University Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and a member of The Planetary Society's board of directors, said. 'This workshop was an important step in community-building among the many groups interested in Mars science and exploration.' The Society's CEO (and former TV 'Science Guy') Bill Nye, said: 'Getting humans to Mars is far more complex than getting to Earth's Moon,' said Nye. 'But space exploration brings out the best in us. 'By reaching consensus on the right set of missions, we can send humans to Mars without breaking the bank.' The workshop's 70 attendees discussed the technical feasibility, affordability and benefits of a proposed schedule to get humans into orbit around Mars and eventually onto the planet's surface, using a detailed plan was not created by The Planetary Society, but was proposed in a separate report co-created by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Phobos is the larger and inner of the two natural satellites of Mars, the other being Deimos. Both moons were discovered in 1877. The workshop 'reached a consensus' on a series of key points, including that an orbital mission would be required prior to a crewed mission to the surface of Mars, and an independent cost estimate showed that the program would fit into the NASA budget, assuming the agency 'ends its lead role in the International Space Station.' The 2033 orbital mission was identified as the crucial first step of the plan, comparing it to NASA's Apollo 8 mission, which took astronauts into orbit around the moon before humans landed on the satellite's surface. The Phobos orbital mission would last approximately 30 months, with nine months of travel each way and 12 months in orbit, the panelists said. Crewmembers would be able to study Phobos and Deimos, Mars' other moon, and potentially teleoperate rovers on the Martian surface. The panel said the current plan would use an Orion spacecraft to move crewmembers from Earth into orbit and back down. 'While the conditions for another Apollo-era Kennedy moment don't exist, we have a highly skilled scientific engineering and policy community that is eager to get going on sending humans to Mars,' said Dr. John Logsdon, workshop co-chair and professor emeritus, Space Policy Institute, Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University. 'We believe the consensus points achieved during this workshop can get us moving down the path to the Red Planet.' The 'Humans Orbiting Mars' workshop took place in Washington, D.C. Various forms of propulsion have been touted for a mission to Mars, including chemical, ion (electric) and nuclear. But while nuclear is often said to be the 'holy grail', the team found it did not noticeably shorten the mission over other versions. Shown is an illustration of a concept Mars Transfer Vehicle . Logsdon said he thinks a decision on whether to adopt the plan is 'an issue for the next president.' Hubbard said that, in the past, Mars missions may have been limited by technological or scientific challenges, but that no longer appears to be the case. 'In the past, when the question of humans to Mars came up, I would typically cite a number of major hurdles: biomedical, launch systems and so forth,' he said. 'And as of today, I think that those risks have either been reduced or you know how to minimize them, and so I am at the same place that John [Logsdon] and Bill [Nye] [are], that I think the issue now is […] political will.' Shown is a graph of the different types of propulsion for a mission to Mars, how much they would weigh and their travel time. CECE is a type of chemical propulsion, Nerva is nuclear propulsion, RIT-XT is ion (electric) propulsion and PEMT is Pure Electro-Magnetic Thrust . Owing to the orbits of Earth and Mars there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place. Our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles (54.6 million km), but can be as distant as 250 million miles (400 million km). For this reason spacecraft to Mars, such as the Curiosity rover, have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned. The next window is open from January 2016 to April 2016, and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet. For a future manned mission, they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in one, which will take two years in total. Just getting there will take up to nine months. The astronauts will be there waiting for a year until they can come back - a total of around three years.\",\n",

In a court case likely to cost £150,000, St John's College and a 74-year-old businessman have been locked in a battle over an unkempt hedgerow between their properties in Warwickshire. The bizarre dispute began when Anthony Bethell decided he would pay for work to restore the ancient 180-yard hedge, which marks the boundary between his home and the college's land. Hedge row: Anthony Bethell and St John's College, Oxford are\\xa0embroiled in a row over a stretch of scrubby bushes, with a court case likely to cost £150,000 . The bizarre dispute began when Anthony Bethell decided he would pay for work to restore the ancient 180-yard hedge, which marks the boundary between his home and the college's land . Before starting the work, Mr Bethell thought it best to consult with the college - which is one of the largest landowners in the country - on where exactly he should replant the hedge, so to avoid any costly complications further down the line. But he claims St John's has refused to agree with him on the matter and says he has been forced to take the college to court, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The hedge, which dates back to 1686, divides Mr Bethell's one-acre plot from 1,200 acres of farmland owned by the college. Mr Bethell said: 'As it stands this ancient hedge is in a poor state of repair and is an eyesore. I'm more than happy to pay for the work to restore the hedge and improve and safeguard the rural environment around me, but I need St John's to agree the boundary line – and they just won't sit down and discuss the issue face to face. They've ignored all my approaches and left me with no choice but to go to court. 'I want to do this properly. If I went ahead and did the work without establishing where precisely the boundary lies I could end up creating all sort of problems which would see the college coming after me in future.' A crown court judge said the bushes were quickly becoming 'the most expensive hedge in Warwickshire' Mr Bethell claims St John's College (pictured) has refused to agree with him on the matter and says he has been forced to take the college to court . The retired businessman, who lives with his wife Eileen, 75, commissioned a report on the scrubby bushes, with experts recommending repairing the 'neglected, sparse' hedge. The report stated that fixing the hedgerow would encourage birds to nest, as well as providing habitats for other wildlife. Both Mr Bethell and St John's College have spent £80,000 in legal fees in total, with the cost of a full trial likely to set the parties back £150,000. The huge sum led the judge overseeing the pre-trial hearing at Coventry Crown Court to suggest the bushes are quickly becoming 'the most expensive hedge in Warwickshire'. He reportedly said that both sides may as well 'pile up £30,000 each in a field and light a huge bonfire'. Expensive: Both Mr Bethell and St John's College have spent £80,000 in legal fees in total so far . Mr Bethell, who runs a charitable foundation for deprived children, is wary of the spiralling cost of the case, adding that the college could use the money to fund places for students. 'We could all save ourselves a lot of time if they would just sit down and talk about this simple matter of the boundary,' he said. The hedge is believed to have been planted in 1686 to divide two estates, which merged almost a century later when St John's bought the land.\\xa0The college now owns more than 9,000 acres of land in England. Professor Andrew Parker, the bursar of St John's College, Oxford,\\xa0said: 'The legal action and court proceedings have been initiated by Mr Bethell. 'Despite attempts to settle the matter by meetings between professional advisers and by mediation, the College regrets that it is necessary to have the matter resolved by the courts.'\",\n",

A study by Kärcher has revealed six in ten Brits are too busy to clean their homes . A study of 2,000 people by cleaning equipment company, Kärcher, revealed that a whopping six in ten full-time working Brits are too busy to clean their homes each week. Even more shocking is that now, three months into the new year, many have avoided certain cleaning jobs all together.

A teenage girl was shocked to discover a huge albino snake curled up on top of the radiator in her bathroom. Hannah Brierley, 16, thought her mother was playing a prank when she spotted the six foot-long northern pine snake on a bath mat which was hung up to dry at her home in Rochdale, Manchester. She stared at the reptile for a few minutes until it moved and quickly called for her 40-year-old mother, Karen Marriott, to come upstairs. Mrs Marriott attempted to call the RSCPA at 7am yesterday morning but after she was unable to get through she panicked and dialled 999. She said: 'Hannah was calm at first. She can't even deal with spiders, but I don't think she thought it was real. 'She'd been looking at it for a few minutes until it moved. She thought I was having a joke. 'I felt like a wally dialling 999 but I didn't know what to do. I'm frightened because I don't know how it got in. 'It was like something out of a film. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Everybody needed a wee, but we couldn't go.' Craig Wallace, a detective based at Rochdale police station, overheard the control room call and although it's not a police matter, he offered to help as he has experience with keeping snakes. Det Con Wallace used a pillowcase to capture the white snake and took it back to the station, before being transferred into the care of the RSPCA. The officer added: 'I keep snakes so I know a lot about them. It was a northern pine snake. They can give a nasty bite, but they're not venomous. 'If it did bite you, you would struggle to get it off. I put my hand through a pillow slip then got the back of it's head and wrapped it up.' He believes the reptile may be a family pet which has either escaped or been set free and slithered into the house on during the recent warm weather. Scroll down for video .

Escape: The officer believes the snake may be a family pet that has escaped or been discarded and could have got into the house through an open door or window in the recent warm weather . A regular pine snake, of which the northern pine is a subspecies, in the wild. They vary in colouring . The northern pine snake, or pituophis melanoleucus - a subspecies of the common pine snake - are endemic to south eastern states in the United States, including Alabama and Kentucky. In the wild, colours can vary from to deep-brick to a wine red. Captive varieties tend to be amelanistic or 'albino', which are descendants of a specimen hatched from a wild-collected clutch of eggs. The find occurred near the eastern edge of the Pine Barrens in Ocean County, New Jersey, in the early to mid-1980s. They generally prefer to live in areas with pine flatwoods, sandy pine-oak woodlands or cultivated fields. Pine snakes are carnivorous animals and mainly feed on mice, rats, moles and other small animals. Captive-bred specimens docile behaviour makes them perfect pets and their voracious appetite and rapid growth are some of the reasons for their popularity. Most hatchlings, which are around 12 to 16 inches, will feed immediately and though they may strike and hiss at first, with frequent handling they usually calm down. Adults, which grow between 4ft and 6ft, can be more difficult to calm down if the animal was not handled frequently as a hatchling or juvenile.\",\n",

Experts say the new 6.2 mile-stretch (10 kilometres) means the full range of the Qin Dynasty Great Wall can be traced for the first time. Nine sections of the Wall have been found over the last two months along the inner coast of the Yellow River in Gansu province and the Ningxia region, reported the\\xa0People's Daily online. Still standing: New sections of the Great Wall discovered by a team of experts in northwestern China . Historic: This stretch, measuring more than 6 miles long, is thought to date back more than 2,000 years . Remote: The ruins range along the inner coast of the Yellow River in Gansu province and the Ningxia region . The new stretch, ranging between Jingyuan County and Nanchangtan village, was discovered by a team led by Zhou Xinghua, renowned Great Wall researcher and the former head of Ningxia Museum. Historical documents had suggested that the Emperor Qin ordered for the Great Wall to start in Gansu province and run east into the Ningxia region and Inner Mongolia, but physical evidence in this particular area has never been found until now. Mr Zhou said China's first emperor ordered for the stretch to be built along the Yellow River to stop invaders crossing it when it was frozen. While parts of the Great Wall date back to about 700 BC, the first complete Wall was built during the reign of China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang, from about 220 BC after the country had been unified for the first time. The newly discovered section of the wall was constructed using stones and rammed earth, with some parts built on top of the mountain ranges and others running along valleys. Some of the ruins are only three feet high due to natural degradation, but originally the wall could have been as tall as 20 feet. Other sections:\\xa0Archive photos of the Qin Dynasty Great Wall which is thought to be built around 215 AD . Landmark: A monument is placed near the ruins of the Qin Dynasty Great Wall, which was built by the first emperor to have unified China . There are no surviving records of the exact length of the Qin Wall, and much of the original wall has eroded away leaving few sections behind. The Great Wall is actually made up of many different structures built across northern China and southern Mongolia over a number of dynasties. The best known and most visible section today is the Ming Wall, constructed from 1368 to 1644. The formidable fortress covers approximately 5,500 miles from the Jiayu Pass in Gansu province and the Shanhai Pass in Hebei province. However, it was revealed in 2012 that the Wall is actually 13,170 miles  long – more than double the previous estimate. A Chinese university is spending nearly £450,000 on building their very own Great Wall of China. Wuhan Institute of Bioengineering is currently constructing the replica as a patriotic educational tool that will also get students doing more exercise, according to the People's Daily Online. The 'Campus Great Wall' will act as a walkway that connects the university's two sites, covering a distance of 1.6 kilometres – more than 13,000 times shorter than the original. Replica: Students at the\\xa0Wuhan Institute of Bioengineering are climbing their own Great Wall on campus . The university said the project, which is yet to be completed, is 'not a cheap replica' and the wall looks to copy the original as closely as possible. The project aims to provide students with an opportunity to get to grips with the country's rich cultural history through copies of carvings from the original, as well as famous paintings and poems. A spokesman for the university said in a statement: 'It fulfils a patriotic educational purpose as the Great Wall is a historic achievement by the Chinese people'.\",\n",

She has previously holidayed in the area with the 54-year-old broadcaster but the pair, who have two daughters and a son, are said to have lived apart for  years. Scroll down for video . Holiday: Frances Clarkson, 53, spent the Easter Bank Holiday weekend with family and friends in Barbados . The BBC announced last month they were dropping Clarkson from the hit motoring show after a 'fracas' involving a Top Gear producer. Clarkson left Oisin Tymon needing hospital treatment after punching him at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire, after staff wouldn't serve him a hot meal following a day of filming. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately and it was announced today that he will not face any criminal charges for the attack. Rushing to his side to comfort him throughout the ordeal has been events organiser Phillipa Sage, 45, who became a feature in his life in 2010 when he was still in a relationship with Frances. It was claimed last year that his marriage had been under strain after reports he had engaged in extra-martial affairs. Last summer he told the MailOnline's Piers Morgan he was 'going through a difficult divorce'. In April 2011 Clarkson was accused of having an affair with Miss Sage while touring Australia, South Africa and Norway with his Top Gear co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May. Sunshine: Frances was spotted in a black bikini as she drove a jet ski and caught some rays in the sun . Relax: The 53-year-old has previously holidayed on the island with her estranged husband Jeremy Clarkson . He was alleged to have spent several nights with Miss Sage and kissed her on the lips in full view of observers on one occasion. Clarkson shrugged off the claims at the time, saying that he and Miss Sage had been simply 'colleagues fooling around'. But shortly afterwards it was revealed that he was spending time during the week living in a bachelor pad in London. He denied that he had moved out of the family home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, saying he used the London flat when he was editing Top Gear. Clarkson was photographed kissing Miss Sage while on holiday with her in Greece in 2013, and they also visited Australia again. In October 2011 Clarkson lifted a High Court gagging order preventing his first wife, Alex Hall, from claiming that he had had an affair with her after he married Frances.

Clarkson married Frances in 1993 and she encouraged him to cultivate a more aggressive on-screen persona to make Top Gear more controversial, say friends. In recent years he has been caught up in other controversies, including being accused of racism after he called an Asian man a 'slope' when he joked about the construction of a bridge in Thailand during an episode of Top Gear.

              " {'sequence': \"Millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst has pleaded not guilty to two weapons charges related to his arrest last month, further delaying his extradition to California to face murder charges. Durst entered his plea during an arraignment in a New Orleans court on weapons charges that accused him of possessing a firearm after a felony conviction and possessing both a firearm and an illegal drug, marijuana. Durst's hands were shackled to his sides, and two defense attorneys lifted him from an armchair to his feet to walk to the podium. Unlikely to face charges in California anytime soon: Robert Durst, 71, pleaded not guilty Thursday to two state gun charges in Louisiana in a case that would delay his extradition to LA to face murder charges. Durst is pictured here last month in New Orleans . Attorney Dick DeGuerin whispered into Durst's ear as he entered the plea. He had to whisper twice before Durst said, 'I am not guilty, your honor.' Judge Franz Zibilich asked if Durst was making that plea to both charges against him. DeGuerin whispered again, and Durst said, 'Yes, your honor.' The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of a longtime friend. Durst is being held without bail in the mental ward of a state prison. Durst's story also is playing out two miles away in federal court in New Orleans. An affidavit filed there accuses Durst of breaking a federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms. Prosecutors have asked a U.S. magistrate judge to order Durst to be brought to federal court for a hearing next Thursday — and that he remain in U.S. custody until the federal matter is resolved. Durst, an estranged member of the family that runs 1 World Trade Center in New York, has had multiple run-ins with the law over his nearly 72 years. He was arrested in New Orleans last month on the eve of the finale of a six-part HBO documentary called 'The Jinx' about Durst, the disappearance of his first wife in 1982, the death of a longtime friend in 2000 and the death and dismemberment of a neighbor in Galveston in 2001. Murdered: Susan Berman, who acted as a media spokesperson for Durst in the wake of his wife's disappearance, was shot in the head at her LA home in 2000, just as the cold case into the disappearance of Kathleen Durst was reopened. Durst was charged with Berman's murder last month . A self-defense plea won acquittal in the death of Morris Black, but Durst is charged in Los Angeles with murder in the death of longtime friend Susan Berman, 55, who was shot in the head in 2000. Berman, an author, acted as a media spokesperson for Durst in the wake of his wife's disappearance. The Jinx suggested she knew a lot about Durst. Her death coincided with the cold case of Kathleen Durst's disappearance being reopened. Durst's lawyers, DeGuerin and Billy Gibbens, have said repeatedly that he just wants to go to California to deal with that charge. They also have challenged the weapons charges on several grounds, including the allegation that the FBI 'rummaged' through Durst's belongings before getting an arrest or search warrant. But Andrea Armstrong, a criminal law professor at Loyola University in New Orleans, said Wednesday that 'the fact that it was warrantless doesn't necessarily mean it was unconstitutional.' There are at least 11 circumstances, starting with consent, that make it legal to search without a warrant, she said. DeGuerin also has argued that the two felonies to which Durst pleaded guilty in Pennsylvania — possessing a firearm while a fugitive and doing so while under indictment — are not among those that would make it illegal for him to have a gun. Until his indictment Wednesday, Durst had been arrested but not formally charged in connection with the .38-caliber revolver authorities say was found in his room at the J.W. Marriott, where he was staying under the name Everette Ward. According to court testimony, an FBI agent recognized Durst in a New Orleans hotel March 14 and escorted him to his hotel room. Durst was arrested early March 15 on the Los Angeles warrant and arrested separately on the weapons charges the next day. Durst's lawyers say the arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the final episode of 'The Jinx,' which also described the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, in 1982 from New York; the Los Angeles shooting of Berman, 55, in 2000; and Black's death in 2001.\",\n",

They are mementoes of a brilliant career in movies, stretching from the tunnels of The Great Escape to the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and Gandhi’s vast crowd scenes. Richard Attenborough was present – behind or in front of the camera – at some of the most magical moments in cinema history, and following his death aged 90 last year, the actor-director’s treasured possessions are going up for up sale at auction house Bonhams. Lord Attenborough’s son Michael, himself an acclaimed theatre director, said: ‘The items reflect my father’s incredible career. 'It is simply not possible to keep it all, even though we would absolutely love to. We do not have the room for it.’ Lord Attenborough made his big-screen debut in the 1942 film In Which We Serve, and was still acting more than five decades later when he appeared as eccentric boffin John Hammond in Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park. He was an avid collector and the lots include a treasure trove of unseen photographs, iconic props, scripts, posters and sketches. Many of the lots relate to his time in front of the camera and include mementoes from such career-defining films as Brighton Rock, The Great Escape and 10 Rillington Place. The Great Escape: This photo of Richard Attenborough (front) and Steve McQueen is expected to sell for £700 . One of the most prized items is the cane (left) used by Hammond in Jurassic Park, which is estimated to sell for £5,000. The rare poster (right) is among the items for sale advertising\\xa0Brighton Rock under the film’s original title . The actor was nearly 70 when he appeared in Jurassic Park – lured by the prospect of working with Steven Spielberg . One of the most prized items is the cane used by Hammond in Jurassic Park. The top contains a prehistoric mosquito preserved in amber, from which the DNA used to create the dinosaurs in the park was extracted. A clapperboard from the film Gandhi is up for sale . The exhibition will also remind fans that there was a time when Britain’s brightest star struggled to find work. One of the lots is an early CV written by Lord Attenborough when he was an ambitious student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. The student carefully noted all the stage roles he had notched up while at RADA. Equally well known for his work behind the camera, Lord Attenborough directed such classics as Gandhi, Shadowlands and Cry Freedom. His personal script for the Oscar-winning masterpiece Gandhi, which includes all of his annotations, is expected to fetch in the region of £3,000. Michael Attenborough said there were some items the family couldn’t part with, even if they wanted to. ‘We are not allowed to sell his Oscars and Baftas for legal reasons, and to be honest we wouldn’t want to,’ he said. ‘They have been distributed along the family and are now being looked after by the grandchildren.’ Michael Attenborough suggested Ben Kingsley (right) for the role of Gandhi – a decision his father never regretted . His role as the psychotic Pinkie in 1947’s Brighton Rock made Attenborough a box-office star. he is pictured here relaxing with young fans between scenes . Lord Attenborough was an avid collector of 20th Century British paintings and the sale features many works that hung in his homes in London and Scotland. These include a fine oil painting by Alan Lowndes which is expected to fetch £15,000, and a caricature of Oscar Wilde by Max Beerbohm which has a guide price of £7,000. The auction, entitled Richard Attenborough: A Life Both Sides Of The Camera, will take place at Bonhams on October 21. Lord Attenborough’s prized Rolls-Royce Corniche with its distinctive number plate, RA III, will be sold separately at a Bonhams sale at the Beaulieu National Motor Museum on September 5.

Tate Britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of an export permit will bolster their claim that the 1824 oil painting – Beaching A Boat, Brighton – was legitimately brought to Britain. The 1946 document bears the signature of a dealer called Karola Fabri and seeks permission for the transfer of artworks from Budapest to Zurich, including one by Constable identified as Fishing Boat. Scroll down for video . New evidence?\\xa0Tate Britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of a 1946 export permit (pictured) will bolster their claim that Constable's painting was legitimately brought to Britain . Constable's masterpiece Beaching A Boat, Brighton\\xa0was looted by the Nazis from its Jewish owner during the Second World War . The discovery of the permit in the archives of Budapest’s Museum of Fine Arts is the latest twist in an increasingly fraught dispute between the Tate and the descendants of the painting’s original owner, Baron Ferenc Hatvany, who died in 1958. The descendants of Hatvany – believed to be two daughters and a grandchild – say the Nazis stole the painting and smuggled it out of Hungary. It turned up in Britain in 1962 and passed through several hands before being donated to the Tate in 1986. The family launched a claim three years ago. The Government-backed Spoliation Advisory Panel, which rules on disputes over looted art, supported the heirs last year and said the Tate had a ‘moral obligation’ to return the painting. Sources close to the case say the export permit could prove the Tate’s claim that Hatvany voluntarily disposed of the painting while he was still alive. The Tate does not dispute that the painting was looted by the Nazis but the gallery’s understanding is that it was returned to the owner after the war and then legitimately exported. Stormy seas: The battle over Constable's painting evokes the story of a Jewish refugee's fight to reclaim a looted picture in the film Woman in Gold (pictured) Gallery chiefs are expected to argue that the permit proves the work was still in Hungary after the war. But The Mail on Sunday understands the claimants will argue the permit doesn’t change anything as it does not identify Hatvany. One source said: ‘If you had stolen the painting, you would still need to get an export permit to get it out of the country.’ A source at the Tate explained that there was legal duty to protect any assets owned by the British public, which is why the gallery argued that the painting should remain in the UK. They said: ‘No one disputes that the picture was at one stage looted by the Nazis, what is in dispute is what happened after it was returned to its owner.’ The dispute evokes the story of Dame Helen Mirren’s new film, Woman In Gold, which charts the story of how Jewish refugee Maria Altmann battled for almost a decade with the Austrian government to reclaim Gustav Klimt’s iconic picture of her aunt called Portrait Of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.\",\n",

Earlier today, it plugged its in-flight refuelling (IFR) probe into the hose of an Omega Air KC-707 tanker off the coast of Maryland. During the test, it trailed the Omega Air Refuelling 707 tanker from a mile off before using optical sensors and a video camera to monitor its approach to within 20 feet (six metres). Depending on the weather, the aerial refuelling demonstrations are due to last throughout the weekend. The drone is about the size of an F/A-18 Super Hornet, weighs in at 44,000 lb (20,000kg) and has a 62ft (20m) wingspan. Salty Dog 502 is one of two Unmanned Carrier Air Vehicle demonstrators (UCAS-D) on the X-47B program . The goal of each of the refuelling demonstrations is to transfer 3,000lbs of fuel in five minutes. But this is the final test of the historic X-47B, which will now be donated to museums despite, according to Foxtrot Alpha, only having 20 per cent of their flight hours used up. Refuelling in flight is the last hurdle for the Northrop Grumman-built jet, claims to Captain Beau Duarte, program manager of the Navy's Unmanned Carrier Aviation. With a wingspan of 130 feet, the Triton is wider than commercial airliners such as the Boeing 737 . An airliner-sized Navy surveillance drone made its first transcontinental flight in September, flying 11 hours across the US. The cross-country test was the first for the MQ-4C Triton, which will play a role in the Navy's planned Broad Area Maritime Surveillance program. The drone can provide blanket surveillance for the Navy as part of the branch's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance program. Triton uses 'radar, infrared sensors and advanced cameras to provide full-motion video and photographs' to Navy personnel. Northrop Grumman says the unmanned aircraft also has a capacity to fly up to 28 hours at a time and surveil 1million square miles in a single mission. With a wingspan of 130 feet, the Triton is wider than commercial airliners such as the Boeing 737. Mid-air refuelling is difficult enough for human pilots, but the ability for drones to do it could eman they only ever have to land for equipment updates. The Navy envisions the X-47B's successors, the UCLASS drones, as making 24-7 patrols around aircraft carriers. 'We will have met all of the program's mission objectives and will [take] those lessons learned, fold them into the UCLASS performance specification,' Duarte said. The X-47B drone is about the size of an F/A-18 Super Hornet, weighs in at 44,000 lb (20,000kg) and has a 62ft (20m) wingspan .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"A Chinese court has jailed a 71-year-old journalist for seven years for leaking a government document warning against the 'dangers' of a free press. Gao Yu - named one of the International Press Institute's 50 'world press heroes' in 2000 - 'illegally provided state secrets to foreigners', Beijing's No. 3 Intermediate People's Court said on a verified social media account today. The ruling stated Gao had leaked a 2013 directive by the ruling Communist party named 'Document number 9' to a Hong Kong media outlet. Gao Yu, 71, has been jailed for seven years for 'illegally providing state secrets to foreigners' in the shape of a government document warning against the 'dangers' of press freedom to a Hong Kong media outlet . Chinese police push away journalists waiting outside Beijing's No. 3 Intermediate People's Court for today's verdict in Gao Yu's case . China's current President Xi Jinping has overseen a harsh crackdown against critics of the ruling Communist Party, with scores of journalists, lawyers and academics detained and dozens jailed . The document warns of the 'dangers' of multiparty democracy, independent media, 'universal' definitions of human rights and criticism of the party's historical record, according to copies widely circulated online. 'We are very disappointed with this verdict,' said Shang Baojun, one of her lawyers, who argued in court that a 'confession' from Gao had been extracted after threats were made against her son. Gao is 'the victim of vaguely worded and arbitrary state-secret laws that are used against activists as part of the authorities' attack on freedom of expression,' said William Nee, a researcher for Britain-based Amnesty International. Known for her outspoken support for democracy and press freedom, Gao went missing last April and resurfaced on China's state broadcaster a month later admitting she had made a 'mistake'. Shang said the main evidence presented at Gao's trial in November was a 'confession' she made after police threatened the journalist's son, who they had also detained. He added that after the verdict was read out Gao stated in a 'strong voice' that she would appeal, but was not allowed to make any further statement. The court denied the defence access to documents used to convict her, the lawyer said. The septuagenarian suffers from high blood pressure and Shang added he was 'very worried' about her health. Chinese courts are tightly controlled by the ruling party and more than 99 percent of defendants are convicted, with appeals rarely successful. Police and security staff pushed foreign journalists hoping to cover the verdict more than 100 metres away from the courthouse, and bundled a Chinese individual into a police vehicle. Police take down the details of journalists outside the court where Gu's trial was held. Reporters were pushed more than 100 metres away from the courthouse .

China's current President Xi Jinping has overseen a harsh crackdown against critics of the ruling Communist Party, with scores of journalists, lawyers and academics detained and dozens jailed. The country's definition of 'state secrets' is notoriously broad, taking in the number of people executed each year, information about pollution and databases listing commercial companies. A consistent advocate for democracy and free speech, Gao was imprisoned following the government crackdown on student protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Her political writings saw her jailed for six years in the 1990s, also on a charge of 'leaking state secrets'. She was detained again in the lead-up to the Tiananmen crackdown's 25th anniversary last year, as were dozens of other government critics, and her one-day trial was conducted in secret. Prosecutors said that a researcher affiliated with China's agriculture ministry gave Gao a copy of 'Document number 9' in 2013, according to a copy of the verdict posted online by friends of Gao and confirmed to AFP by Shang. The prosecution said she had used the online telecommunications tool Skype to transfer the document to Ho Pin, head of Hong Kong-based publishing house Mirror Books, one of many outlets which has released the text in the last two years.

Gao Yu is one of a number of prominent Chinese dissidents who have been detained, exiled or kept under house arrest in recent years . Mirror Books denied receiving the document from Gao in a statement posted online Friday. 'This so-called 'secret document' is not concerned with military secrets, or even economic secrets. It is a mere guide to ideology,' it added. The US said last year it was 'deeply concerned' by the criminal proceedings against Gao. Her arrest 'was part of an effort to intimidate and silence journalists and activists' ahead of the Tiananmen anniversary, the US chapter of free speech group PEN International said in a statement. The verdict was 'another blow to free expression and press freedom in China', it added. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the case had been handled 'in accordance with the law'. 'This is a matter of China's internal sovereignty,' he told reporters. Ahead of the ruling, France-based Reporters Without Borders said it would be a gauge of 'how far the Chinese authorities are ready to go in order to suppress those who speak with an independent voice'. The group ranked China 176th out of 180 countries in its 2015 Press Freedom Index.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"They already have a fearsome reputation as the top predator of their time, but it seems the Tyrannosaurs were also prone to eating each other. A new study has uncovered evidence that a relative of Tyrannosaurus rex, called Daspletosaurus, may have indulged in cannibalism. Paleontologists have found bite marks on the fossilised skull of a juvenile Daspletosaurus, which lived around 75 million years ago. This artist's reconstruction shows a Daspletosaurus feeding on the body of another in an act of cannibalism . While some of the injuries appear to have been sustained during combat with other tyrannosaurs, others appear to have occurred after death. The scientists believe that another Daspletosaurus, which could grow to nine metres (30ft) as adults and weigh up to four tons, fed on the youngster's body. Tyrannosaurus rex and its relatives were more intelligent than previously thought and hunted in gangs which included young and older members, researchers have claimed. Scientists believe they have evidence that the top predatory dinosaurs were highly intelligent pack animals, despite T-rex being popularly depicted as a dangerous but dim-witted loner. This is a myth that has grown up because for many years their fossil skeletons tended to be found on their own, researchers say. The new theory follows an analysis of skeletons of the tyrannosaur Tarbosaurus bataar from 90 sites in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia. Tarbosaurus, a cousin of T-rex that lived around 70 million years ago, was a two-legged predator up to 12 metres long and weighing five tonnes. At least half a dozen of the animals appear to have belonged to a single social group, including adults and juveniles, that died together. The findings help to shed light on the brutal world in which the dinosaurs inhabited. Dr David Hone, a paleontologist at Queen Mary University of London, who led the research said: 'This animal clearly had a tough life, suffering numerous injuries across the head including some that must have been quite nasty. 'The most likely candidate to have done this is another member of the same species, suggesting some serious fights between these animals during their lives.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal PeerJ, were examining the skull of a Daspletosaurus found in a quarry in the Dinosaur Provincial Park close to Calgary, Alberta in Canada in 1994. Daspletosaurus, which means 'frightful lizard', is thought to be a close relative of the more famous Tyrannosaurus rex and roamed north America between 77 million and 74 million years ago. With a massive, heavy skull that could be more than 3ft (1 metre) in length, it would have had a powerful bite and probably preyed on large armoured ceratopsid dinosaurs. The dinosaur latest study was thought to be a juvenile, measuring just under 19.7 feet (6 metres) and weighed around half a tonne. The researchers found numerous injuries on the skull, several of which appeared to match the teeth of tyrannosaurs. The skull of the juvenile\\xa0Daspletosaurus (above) was covered in bite marks made by Tyrannosaur teeth . David Hone (left) and Darren Tanke (right) studied the fossilised skull at the Royal Tyrrell Museum . One bite to the back of the head broke off part of the skull and left a circular tooth-shaped puncture through the bone. However, there are signs the bone had begun healing, suggesting the injury was not fatal and that the animal lived for some time after it was inflicted. While the researchers cannot say what killed the Daspletosaurus, damage on the jaw bones suggest that a large tyrannosaur bit into the dead creature between one and three times in what appears to be feeding behaviour. Daspletosaurus is thought to have not just hunted but also scavenged for food and the research team say the injuries appear to have occurred after it had begun to decay. Cannibalism is relatively common in the natural world, with more than 1,000 species known to eat their own species. The fossilised skull of\\xa0Daspletosaurus was found in a quarry in Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada . Daspletosaurus, shown in the artists reconstruction above,  led a violent life the study suggests . Tyrannosaurus rex is also thought to have indulged in cannibalism, according to a study in 2010. Writing in the journal, Dr Hone and his colleague Darren Tanke from the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta, said the Daspletosaurus appeared to have lived a violent life involving battles with other members of its own species. They said: 'Numerous wounds were inflicted during life and despite some considerable damage the animal clearly survived as shown by the evidence of healing. 'These were likely inflicted at least in part by one or more conspecifics and perhaps as a result of numerous separate instances of conflict. 'After death, the animal suffered at least one major bite to the right dentary, and perhaps two more from another tyrannosaurid, possibly another Daspletosaurus. 'The specimen must have been decaying prior to the delivery of the bite to the dentary, and the condition of other material suggests scavenging, rather than simply late-stage carcass consumption.'\",\n",

Rilie Carey, from Salem, Oregon, learnt the popular song at preschool and was halfway through eating her dinner when she decided to perform it for her mom, Jessica. She starts by confidently singing: 'Four little ducks went out to play, over the hills and far away. 'Mumma duck says quack, quack, quack, quack, but only three little ducks came back.' But as the rhyme continues - and the number of ducks returning to their mother decreases - her eyes begin to fill with tears. As she gets to the penultimate verse, where 'no little ducks come back', she starts to sob with her arm across her face. At the end of the clip Rilie, who lives with her mom, dad and two-year-old brother, leans in for a hug from her mom - despite being told the ducks do actually return. Mrs Carey posted the video on Facebook alongside the caption: 'My four-year-old daughter learned a new song at school yesterday and can't quite get through it without crying. 'She gets so sad that the mama duck doesn't have her babies!! #allthefeels' The 25-year-old, who met Rilie's father Aaron in 2007, told MailOnline: 'I filmed the video because after I had picked Rilie up from school, she would't stop singing it all day and would start to get emotional near the end every single time. 'I recorded it at dinner time so I could show her dad once he got off from work. 'She is so caring and loving and, as a mother, it made my heart explode watching her get so emotional about the mama duck losing her babies. She's so sweet. 'I just adored it. It makes me happy to know how loving her little heart is.' Rilie (left; right) learnt the popular song about ducks at preschool and was halfway through eating her dinner when she decided to perform it for her mother Jessica Carey . Jessica Carey (pictured with her husband Aaron, Rilie and two-year-old son) posted the video on Facebook with the caption: 'My four-year-old daughter learned a new song at school yesterday and can't quite get through it without crying' Mr Carey, a 32-year-old tattoo artist, also shared the video on Facebook and added: 'If you haven't already seen this video, check it out. 'It's my sweet little daughter singing a new song she learned at school. She gets very emotional towards the end lol.' The video has already received more than 2.9million views on Facebook. Hundreds of viewers have commented, with many dubbing the video the 'cutest thing ever'. Mrs Carey is hoping Rilie will now be invited on to The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\",\n",

Our love life is normal. We adapt. Lying down everyone is my size.\\' Happier times: Joelison developed gigantism as a child and his rapidly soaring height forced him to drop out of school due to bullying and then refuse to leave the family house for year . Joelison grew up in a small rural village in Paraiba, northern Brazil and was bullied from a young age due to his height. He got in trouble for fighting his tormentors and later decided to quit school altogether, much to the disappointment of his mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45. She said: \\'From a young age I knew there was something not quite right with Joelison. \\'When he was a baby and only a few months old the baby shoes stopped fitting his feet properly and I\\'d always have to go and buy more and more. \\'I thought \"there’s something wrong here\" but the doctors said he was just a big baby and would stop growing eventually and so we waited for him to stop growing - but he still hasn’t stopped. True love: \\'The first time I saw her it was love at first sight,\\' Joelison said. \\'I was charmed by her. I wanted to be with her all the time. It didn\\'t matter about her size\\' Joelison\\'s mother added: \\'When he got to eight years old I knew he was growing at an abnormal rate and by the time he was 14 he was already 6ft 4in. \\'We lived in the rural zone and nobody knew him. For half of his life he had been hidden away. If anyone came to our house he was so shy he would hide so they wouldn’t see him. \\'I was really worried.\\' Doctors later discovered he had a benign tumour on his pituitary gland that was causing his body to produce uncontrolled amounts of growth hormone. Joelison initially refused to have it removed as he didn\\'t want to spend three months in hospital recovering, even though he was warned it would eventually kill him. But in 2007, after some convincing from his family, he agreed and had it removed using less invasive laser surgery performed through his nose. The successful operation helped slow his growth but he still sprouted another four inches to his current height of 7ft 8in. Long and the short of it: The former gold miner admits their huge height difference has left a few people bewildered, especially when it comes to the dynamics of their love-life, which he says they have \\'adapted to\\' With the gigantism under control, Joelison\\'s confidence grew. The computer games fan finally took a step into the public conscience and was eventually crowned Brazil\\'s tallest man. One TV show took such pity on his plight they made him seven pairs of shoes to fit his enormous size 23 shoe size and custom shirts and shorts to fit his bulky frame. Joelison, who used to work in a gold mine as well as a plantation before leaving due to his health issues, now makes a living appearing in commercials for frozen ready meals. As a celebrity in his homeland he began to attract admirers, including new wife Evem. She contacted him on Facebook to wish him happy birthday and they swapped numbers before starting a committed relationship two months later. Mum: Joelison\\'s mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45 (left), admits she\\'s found it hard to adjust to her son\\'s wife, claiming, \\'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him\\' \\'She was basically my first woman. The first woman of my life. I was 28,\\' said Joelison. \\'I thought everything about her was beautiful - but especially her eyes. \\'She is very caring. She doesn\\'t show it when the cameras are here but she is caring and truthful. She has never lied to me.\\' Just a year later they were married and it didn\\'t take them long to start trying for a family. But Evem, who hopes to find work as a hair stylist, was initially wary of getting intimate. \\'I had a certain amount of fear,\\' she said. \\'I was afraid it wouldn\\'t work out. But it was fine. We have a normal love life.\\' She added: \\'We want to have a family so I track my dates, times, temperature, everything. All I have to do is call him and he understands what is going on. \\'I have polycystic ovaries and so there are months that I don\\'t ovulate. I\\'ve done my exams and already know that my condition makes it more difficult to get pregnant. \\'But he hasn\\'t done his tests so we need him to go and do it so we can see if the problem really is just me.\\' Joelison and Evem are currently trying to start a family, but having difficulty due to Evem\\'s polycystic ovaries . Aside from family planning they also struggle to work together on basic chores like cooking, cleaning and shopping as Joelison\\'s height makes it tough for him to stand up for long periods of time. His new relationship has also caused friction with his mother, who is finding it hard to let him have his independence after 28 years. She said: \\'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him and when I had to share him with someone else it really wasn’t easy. But as a mother I want him to be happy. \\'With his treatment, I’m still the one who takes care of that, I haven’t delegated it to that girl yet. \\'But I will once she gets used to things.\\' Joelison still has monthly injections and four types of daily medication to control his condition and is likely to need even more care as he gets older. However, he has still plans to fulfil many of his dreams, including having a family and travelling abroad. He also finally finished his high-school education last year after studying at home. On top of this, he is soon due to fly to a Paris convention where he will meet others with gigantism, including the tallest man in the world, Sultan Kösen from Turkey. And Joelison, who is thought to be the third tallest man in the world, says he is looking forward to the novelty of being smaller than someone for once. \\'The most interesting thing is going to be standing face to face with someone,\\' he said. \\'The last time I did that I was a child.\\' Evem (left) hopes to find work as a hair stylist, while Joelison wants to travel the world .',\n",

It’s been raining and the ground is damp, but we are all in our bare feet, which are going numb on the cold, hard concrete. Undeterred, we keep going. There’s a drum pounding in the distance and we keep step with its beat. Marianne Power attended Robbins’ Unleash The Power Within seminarwhich claims to\\xa0‘discover how to identify what it is you really want' The mood is tribal. I feel as if we’re on our way to a ritual killing. Maybe our own. We’ve already signed waivers warning us that what we are about to take part in could result in ‘physical or emotional injury, paralysis, death . . .’ and we’ve spent the past half-an-hour being told what we need to do to avoid hospitalisation. I feel sick with anticipation, but there’s no way out — the huge crowd keeps pushing me forward. Then, the chanting stops and a hush fills the air. We are faced with our fate. It glimmers grey and red in the darkness: lanes of burning hot coals, which we are to walk over. Yes, actually walk over — with our bare feet. We have spent the past two hours preparing for this moment — being whipped into something called ‘peak state’, a place where you are so mentally strong that you can do anything. The idea is that, once you overcome the fear of walking on coals of between 1,200 and 2,000 Fahrenheit, you can ‘conquer the other fires of your life with ease’. But I don’t conquer anything with ease. It’s not in my nature. ‘Am I really doing this?’ is all I can think. But yes, I am. For the past year, I’ve been on a self-improvement mission. Fed up with a life spent worrying, single and broke, I’ve set myself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month. Marianne (pictured) has\\xa0set herself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month and this month she chose that of Anthony Robbins . And, when it comes to the self-improvement world, Anthony Robbins is the king. Everyone from world leaders — Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev — to athletes such as Serena Williams and actors including Hugh Jackman seek his counsel. He even helped Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher. His IS a classic rags-to-riches story. Determined to transcend his poor childhood, he became obsessed with self-improvement. He’d listen to motivational tapes on his way to his job as a janitor, before going on to give motivational talks himself. Fast forward to today and he is a bestselling author and hugely successful business man, whose net worth is in the region of half a billion dollars. He charges $1 million to coach private clients — which is why the rest of us have to settle for listening to him in a concert hall. Anthony Robbins (pictured in the 1990s) charges\\xa0$1 million to coach private clients and is the 'king' of the\\xa0self-improvement world . According to his website, Robbins’ Unleash The Power Within seminar would help me ‘discover how to identify what it is you really want, break through any barriers that might be holding you back, increase your energy and mental clarity, and infuse passion into your life’. Big promises. But the fortysomething woman next to me in the queue to get in promises that he can deliver. She has been three times before, she tells me. ‘When you walk over those coals, something changes,’ she says, her eyes wide. ‘I can’t explain it, but it’s just amazing.’ She has all the fervour of a fanatic. Two physiotherapists from Windsor join in our conversation — they’ve been sent here by their boss. ‘He went last year and got a lot out of it,’ they say. ‘He was on a high for weeks.’ And ‘high’ is the perfect word for the atmosphere. As we file into the arena, there’s chaos as people rush to get good seats — but no one sits in them. They’re too busy dancing along with the music blasting from the speakers. It’s like being at a One Direction concert. After half-an-hour, Tony walks on stage and the screaming goes off the scale. People can hardly contain themselves in the presence of the 6 ft 7 in mountain of a man. With his Hollywood tan, white teeth and lantern jaw, he looks like something that a Mills & Boon writer would dream up. And just to add to the effect, his chiselled face is blown up to God-like proportions on massive screens behind him. It takes minutes for the applause to die down enough for him to speak — but when he starts, he doesn’t stop. His basic message is that anything is possible if we just get our minds and bodies into what he calls the peak state. He says we are all defined by our limiting beliefs and that if we get rid of these then ‘the impossible just gets done’. He is the King of the Catchphrase: ‘It’s impossible to love yourself when you’re not being yourself’; ‘Change your story, change your life . . .’ These nuggets come out of his mouth from 1pm to 9pm. He doesn’t take a tea break and neither do we. It’s extraordinary — I’ve never seen anything like it. Just the sheer energy of him. I find myself thinking that he is the living embodiment of human potential, then I realise I’m swooning. Even world leaders like Nelson Mandela (left) and Bill Clinton (right) have sought the advice and counsel of Anthony Robbins . I turn to the Norwegian man next to me and say: ‘I think I’m in love . . .’ He smiles and says: ‘Me, too.’ We are all under his spell and will do anything he says, including hugging and high-fiving strangers, and punching our fists in the air while yelling: ‘Yes, yes, yes!’ It’s just so un-English. There are moments when I look around at the collective madness and feel as if I’ve become part of a cult, but I have to make a decision: get embarrassed or go with it. I go with it. As the day goes on, we examine our ‘limiting beliefs’. I identify mine as being bad with money and always getting sick. And then he asks us to visualise what life would be like if we got rid of these limiting beliefs. I imagine being healthy, energetic and productive, someone who just gets things done without always worrying about the things that can go wrong. I imagine my bank account being in the black and owning a property. To build on this vision, we’re taught how to get into a peak state by thinking of the best moment of our lives, the moment we felt strongest and most at peace. I think of times with loved ones and professional achievements that I’m proud of. Each time we do we are told to ‘make a move’, so every time we make that move in the future, these memories will come back. I pump my fist in the air, again and again and again. I can’t believe I’m doing it — it’s so not me. I feel as if I’m in the film Rocky. And then the time comes to walk on fire. We’re told to take off our shoes and socks and march out of the conference centre to the 8 ft lines of coal in the car park. Robbins is said to have also helped well-known face including Princess Diana (left) and former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher (right) A part of me wants to run away, but a bigger part of me knows that I can do this. Then I’m standing in front of the coals and two men are instructing me to shout: ‘YES!’ I do. They say ‘Make your move!’ and I pump my fist in the air. Then, I go for it. I put my foot on the coals and after that I remember nothing — until my last step, when I could feel heat. I have half-a-second of panic when I realise what I’m doing — but, by then, my feet are on the cold square of grass put at the end of the fire and my feet are being hosed down by helpers. It’s done. I’ve walked across a bed of hot coals. Two weeks later, I still cannot answer those questions, but I find myself having the same thoughts as the woman I met in the queue at the start of that day. That strange moment of collective hysteria, when we walked over hot coals, has changed something within me. If I can walk on fire without barbecuing my feet, what else can I do? I’m very keen to find out. To follow Marianne’s self-help journey, go to helpmeblog.net .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"A new study has suggested the oral contraceptive pill could shrink parts of the brain that govern a woman's emotions . For the 100 million women worldwide on the contraceptive pill, the side effects are familiar. Mood swings, headaches and nausea,\\xa0while more serious complications include blood clots and breast cancer. But scientists in California have added another potential cause for concern to the check list. Their new study has found the oral contraceptive shrinks two key regions of the brain, changing the way they function. The findings suggest the synthetic hormones found in the Pill cause these alterations in brain structure and function. Furthermore the ingredient is thought to suppress the natural hormones that occur when women take the Pill. Neuroscientists at UCLA examined the brains of 90 women, 44 of whom took the Pill, and 46 who experienced natural cycles. They found the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the posterior cigulate cortex were thinner in those women taking the contraception. The lateral orbitofrontal cortex plays an important role in regulating a person's emotions and their response to rewards. As a result the changes noted by researchers could, they say, be responsible for increased anxiety and depressive symptoms experienced by some women on the Pill. Meanwhile the posterior cingulate cortex governs the 'internal state', or inward-directed thought, helps process emotions and retrieve memories. Nicole Petersen, the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post: 'Some women experience negative emotional side effects from taking oral contraceptive pills, although the scientific findings investigating that have been mixed. 'So it's possible that this change in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex may be related to the emotional changes that some women experience when using birth control pills.' Researchers said they do not yet know if these changes to the brain are permanent, or if they only last while a woman is taking the Pill. Dr Petersen said more research is needed, but added that this study is the first step. The latest study comes five years after research by the Royal College of General Practitioners revealed Pill-users have a 12 per cent reduction in their risk of developing cancer. Scientists at UCLA found the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the posterior cigulate cortex were thinner in those women taking the contraception. They believe it could account for increased anxiety and depressive symptoms experienced by some women taking the Pill . The researchers studied 46,000 women across four decades, and found those on the Pill were less likely to die of cancer, heart disease or stroke. It contradicts past studies that have linked the Pill to breast cancer. The risks associated with taking the Pill are increased if a woman smokes, has a family history of thrombosis, is severely overweight, diabetic, has a high blood pressure or high cholesterol level. The study was published in the journal Human Brain Mapping.\",\n",

New figures released by the MoD show that since 2008, 994 personnel have been treated for mental health issues after having been prescribed Lariam. Despite Lariam - the brand name for the drug mefloquine - being banned by the U.S. military due to concerns over side effects, the MoD has ignored appeals to stop prescribing it in what critics say is an escalating 'scandal'. Major-General Alastair Duncan (pictured) is currently in a psychiatric unit after having been given the drug prior to a deployment in Sierra Leone . According to The Independent's Jonathan Owen, retired Major General Alastair Duncan is currently in a psychiatric unit following a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder episode four months ago. Maj-Gen Duncan was given the drug Lariam before a deployment to Sierra Leone. His wife Ellen told the paper: 'If 1,000 troops have reported the effects then you can be sure there are others who have not. I know personally of several and anecdotally of many more. The long-term effects of this will be more and more in evidence over the coming years.' Mrs Duncan's comments follow those from string of former military servicemen who have hit out at the MoD over its continuing use of Lariam. General Lord Dannatt told the paper it was 'extraordinary' the MoD continued to prescribe Lariam given the weight of evidence about its side effects, and urged it to use other anti-malaria medicines. Lariam's use by the U.S. military has also been closely scrutinized. The drug has been heavily discredited by the country's medicine watchdog. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns Lariam can cause serious mental health issues and should not be taken by anyone suffering from depression. These include anxiety, seizures, paranoia, hallucinations, and depression. In 2013, the organisation gave it a 'boxed warning' - the most serious of its kind - due to the neurological and psychiatric side effects associated with it. It stated: 'Neurologic side effects can occur at any time during drug use, and can last for months to years after the drug is stopped or can be permanent.' It went on to state that such symptoms interfered with patients' daily activities and ability to work, and in some cases were noticed after having taken only one or two doses. The U.S. military banned Lariam after it was linked to the case of Robert Bales, a soldier who massacred 16 Afghan civilians. Mefloquin is used to treat malaria and was developed by Army researchers towards the end of the Vietnam War. It gained support among the fighting forces because it works in areas where mosquitoes developed resistance to an earlier treatment, chloroquine, and requires just one tablet a week, not the daily dose needed with other medications. Side effects include seizures, depression, hallucinations, violent behaviour, feeling that others want to harm you, thoughts of hurting or killing yourself and many others. Almost four decades after inventing it, the U.S. Army pushed it to the back of its medicine cabinet. The about-face followed years of complaints and concerns that mefloquine caused psychiatric and physical side effects. In recent years, the Army slashed by almost 75 per cent the amount of mefloquine it prescribes, even as it sent thousands more soldiers to malaria-prone Afghanistan. Soldiers who had suffered from traumatic brain injuries were particularly advised against using it. 'Mefloquine is a zombie drug. It's dangerous, and it should have been killed off years ago,' said Dr. Remington Nevin, an epidemiologist and Army major who has published research that he said showed the drug can be potentially toxic to the brain.\",\n",

At the time the term was used to describe small, country homes used by the wealthy upper classes as a retreat to escape the heat of pulsing Indian cities. The design soon infiltrated British architecture. Briggs, a renowned architect, published his interpretation of the style in the 1891 book Bungalows and Country Residences. A hallmark of the traditional Indian-Victorian bungalow was a large veranda at the front of a property like the one found at Pleasaunce Cottage. Set over 2,542sq ft, the house has four bedrooms, four reception rooms and a cellar.\\xa0The main sitting room is double height with a gallery and the original inglenook fireplace. Its current owner has lived in the property for more than 30 years, having bought the house in 1983. Unlike bungalows as they are referred to today, the property is set over three levels. The original term was not exclusive to one-storey properties, instead referring to mountain retreats favoured by the Upper Classes . An architect's drawing of the property in the 20th Century. Historians are eager to put the house forward for listing to further protect its heritage . One of the house's most distinct features is its large veranda at the front. These were a common feature among Victorian properties in India . The house's current owner said she fell in love with its unique design and layout when she bought it in 1983 and has tried to preserve its character . Other unique features which make the property so notable are two stained glass windows that have Victorian messages inscribed on them . One of the four bedrooms in the house that is set over more than 2,000sq ft. Original oak and wood flooring has been maintained . The property has four bedrooms, four reception rooms and two bathrooms, one of which is en-suite. It is being sold for £985,000 . 'It’s a great place, I fell in love with it 32 years ago and I still love it after all these years,' said Marian Parker, 60. 'The big drawing room is double height and has this little gallery which I use as a study. The room opens on to the veranda and is a lovely room with lots of light in summer but it also has an open fireplace and is really cosy in winter. 'It looks very different from the front to the back. From the front it looks like a normal bungalow but when you go round to the back it looks like a three-storey house because you can see the cellar.' With two stained glass windows and an original oak panelling in the hall and lounge, historians are eager to put the property forward to be listed. Dr Kathryn Ferry, an architectural historian and author of the book Bungalows, said: 'This is one of the earliest surviving bungalows in Britain and certainly one of the most important. 'What makes this one so significant is it was part of a bungalow settlement as if built in India on a hill station where the colonial British went to escape from the heat of the cities, sitting on their verandas in the cool breeze. 'There are a couple of bungalows in the development left but this one is the most original. 'Bungalows weren’t about single storey living, they were more of a leisure house and this exemplifies that. Bungalows aren’t just boring suburban homes. 'It is not listed but it ought to be. We can’t put it forward for listing yet in case it puts off buyers. But hopefully whoever does buy it will appreciate its importance enough to support a bid to list it.' The house is being sold \\xa0by Hamptons International for £985,000 and has not yet attracted any offers. A view of the property from one of its gardens. It is set over almost one acre of land in the Sussex countryside in East Grinstead . While the house is one of many of the same style built in the area by architect RA Briggs, historians have described it as one of the best remaining examples of a Victorian-Indian bungalow .\",\n",

Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Facebook-owned virtual reality (VR) experts Oculus said at the firm's annual F8 conference in San Francisco said The Matrix provides the best sense of what virtual reality could someday be like. He said our brain never sees the real world, but instead infers it based on the 'sparse' data it receives and used a series of optical illusions to make this point. For example, he explained that humans only have three colour sensors, we can’t see infrared or ultraviolet and we have a blind spot in each eye. ‘Our visual data is actually astonishingly sparse and even if we were able to accurately record and process every photon that reaches our eyes, we’d still have too little data to be able to reconstruct the world accurately,' he said. He used the recent black and blue/white and gold dress as an example. ‘Our visual system takes its best guess and sends that to the conscious mind,’ he continued. 'The way that the brain compensates for the limited data it receives is by maintaining a model of the real world that it constantly updates as new data comes in. Google offers its Google Cardboard headset (pictured) for free by downloading the folding instructions. Or users can buy pre-folded versions from designers for around $24.99 (£16.75) Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Oculus recently used this image to show how vision is simply our perception of the world, but isn't realty. The pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them . 'And it is that model, not the real world, that you experience and trust implicitly. We are inference machines, not objective observers. He then showed a red and blue pill on hands that were shown on a yellow background to give an example of how this inference model breaks down. The colours of the pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them. And even when a person knows that the pills are grey, they still see them as red or blue. ‘Your visual system isn’t interested in whether the photons coming from a tile on a random image are red or blue or grey,' Mr Abrash continued. 'Knowing that didn’t keep anyone from being eaten by lions on the Savannah. What it is interested in is identifying potentially relevant features, in the real world, under a variety of conditions. 'Your visual system constantly corrects for the colours in the scene. It is reverse engineering reality rather than just recording it. The colours seen are your brain’s “best guess.”’\",\n",

Clinicians are in an ‘impossible situation’ as a result of the King family’s flight to Spain after disagreeing with doctors who were treating him in the UK. Doctors and nurses who treated Ashya King have criticised his parents while speaking out for the first time in a BBC documentary. Scroll down for video . Clinicians in an ‘impossible situation’ as a result of King family’s flight to Spain after disagreeing with doctors . Ashya was being treated in Southampton when his parents took him from the hospital and fled abroad without telling staff last year. They ignored medical advice and took him to Prague for proton beam therapy, ultimately paid for by the NHS Trust after he left the UK. Paediatric intensive care consultant Dr Peter Wilson told the documentary: ‘It does put clinicians in an impossible position because we now have to try to explain to families why one child... is getting a form of treatment, why they can’t and they’ve got the same tumour. 'That’s deeply unfair when the NHS is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all.’ After fleeing the UK, the Kings were arrested in Spain and spent several nights in custody after an international arrest warrant was issued against them. Ashya was made a ward of court by Portsmouth council before a national outcry led to their release. His parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 46, wanted him to have cutting-edge proton beam therapy instead which is thought to be less harmful. Because it is so highly targeted they claimed it could avoid healthy tissue, particularly tissues and organs behind the tumour. The family then went to Prague for proton beam therapy, and now say there is 'no evidence' of a tumour . A High Court judge approved the move to take Ashya to Prague for proton beam therapy. The NHS later agreed to fund Ashya’s treatment in Prague. In March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Brett King told a national newspaper a recent scan showed ‘no evidence’ of the tumour. But cancer experts have told the BBC although it appears Ashya is in remission it is far too early to say he has been completely cured. Speaking to the documentary, staff at the hospital said they had been viciously attacked in the wake of the story. Dr Wilson said: ‘As soon as the story broke, and it became a story of a hospital who was chasing down a family, we were inundated. Paediatric intensive care consultant Dr Peter Wilson said it was 'deeply unfair when the NHS is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all’ that he had to say no to parents wanting proton beam therapy for their children . ‘At one stage, especially on the Monday, our switchboard was basically shut because of the number of phone calls we were receiving; the number of messages that were left ... vitriolic messages for everybody. ‘The overwhelming sentiment was one of just an absolute outpouring of hatred. One of the letters said they wished my children got cancer and died.’ Paediatric oncology consultant Dr Ramya Ramanujachar, also involved in Ashya’s treatment, warned the case could set a worrying precedent. She said: ‘I don’t think the parents can look after their own child with a brain tumour and be not only the carers but also the professionals directing, managing and dictating their child’s treatment.’\",\n",

A two-mile Victorian railway tunnel which was closed as part of the Beeching cutbacks could reopen as Britain's longest cycle tunnel . The disused Rhondda Tunnel, which runs 1,000 feet beneath the Welsh hills, was closed 50 years ago . It was shut down as part of the sweeping Beeching Report, which spelled the end for thousands and stations across the rail network . Under the proposals, it would be one of the longest cycle tunnels in the world, second only to the 4,000m Snoqualmie Tunnel near Seattle in the U.S. It would also mean cyclists could retrace the route where steam locomotives carried coal from the Rhondda Valley to the port city of Swansea - something which supporters  believe could be a huge boom to the tourist industry. Leanne Wood, leader of Plaid Cymru, said: 'There is a real buzz about this project which could transform these valleys if the tunnel is opened up.' The railway tunnel, the seventh biggest in Britain, runs beneath the mountains under the Dunraven Forest in the South Wales Valleys. But engineers are due to visit the 3,148m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route . The railway tunnel, which runs beneath the mountains under the Dunraven Forest in the South Wales Valleys, was opened in 1890 in the coal boom. It was then closed in 1968 . It was opened in 1890 during the coal boom, after a five-year building project, which was overseen by the tunnel's chief engineer Sydney William Yockney, a pupil of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. But both ends of the tunnel - at Blaencwm in the Rhondda and Blaengwynfi in the Afan Valley - were filled in during the 1970s. It came following a report by Dr Richard Beeching, a civil servant from the Isle of Sheppy, who wrote a report called\\xa0Reshaping of British Railways, which led to far-reaching changes in the transport network. The engineer had been employed to make the entire network more profitable, prompting him to recommend the closure of stations and railway lines which did not make money. The tunnel runs from Blaencwm in the Rhondda Valley to Blaengwynfi in the Afan Valley (shown in map) How the tunnel's length will compare to those around the world, according to the Rhonda Tunnel Society . Under the proposals, it would be one of the longest cycle tunnels in the world, second only to the 4,000m Snoqualmie Tunnel near Seattle in the U.S . Although some 3,000 miles of railway lines were closed before the report, he became infamous for causing the closures of several rural stations. The report became commonly known as the Beeching Axe. After falling victim to the report, the abandoned Rhondda Tunnel lay dormant for nearly 50 years. But the Rhondda Tunnel Society formed a few years ago in a bid to secure funding for the tunnel's excavation. The Highways Agency Historic Railways Estate has now contracted a construction and engineering company to undertake the three-day inspection of the tunnel, alongside the Mines Rescue Service. Rhondda Tunnel Society chairman Stephen Mackey said it would be a 'heart-stopping' three days. The chief engineer of the tunnel (left) was Sydney William Yockney, a pupil of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who oversaw the five-year building project which it began in 1885. Pictured right:\\xa0Workers at the Rhonnda  Tunnel . The Highways Agency Historic Railways Estate has contracted a construction and engineering company to undertake the three-day inspection of the tunnel, alongside the Mines Rescue Service . The Rhondda Tunnel Society formed with the sole purpose of reopening the Victorian locomotive route . He said: 'The engineers will be walking the length of the tunnel across three days looking at the safety of the structure to see what it's like after 47 years and to see if it is possible to re-open the tunnel. 'As well as the structural integrity they will be checking for such things as sulphuric acid which can occur in stagnant water and to check carbon dioxide levels to make sure it's breathable down there.' He added: 'With the interest of the world looking in on the project, the inspections next week are going to be crucial with engineers being in the dark depths of the tunnel evaluating its integrity. 'These are exciting times for us but also a heart-stopping three days. Then we will have the wait for the report and the subsequent findings.'

Engineer Dr Richard Beeching, whose report led to the reduction of the British railway network . In 1963, Dr Richard Beeching, a civil servant from the Isle of Sheppey, was recruited by the government to write a report about how to make the railway network more profitable. After being recruited from the job from ICI, he produced a report called Reshaping of British Railways - a document which changed the face of British railways forever. At the time, railway lines were extensive across Britain and even very remote areas had stations. But, with the industry hemorrhaging money, Dr Beeching's solution was to close down the parts - including stations and lines - which did not make money. He recommended axing about one third of the network, which equated to around 5,000 miles of track. This included hundreds of branch lines, 2,363 stations and tens of thousands of jobs lost on the grounds of cost or efficienvy. His recommendations left Britain with 13,721 miles of railway lines in 1966, while a further 2,000 miles were lost by the end of the 1960s. Dr Beeching argued it was more important to invest in fast journeys between the cities and to replace some branch lines with improved bus services. But the report became infamous and Dr Beeching was criticised for ignoring the social benefits of having a rail line. His programme also never made the savings he promised. However, many critics failed to recognise that the government had already cut 3,000 miles of track before Dr Beeching's input, something which was continued by successive governments.\",\n",

A historic photograph found by Mr Hamilton-Miller's family shows him watching on as camp commander Josef Kramer, known as The Beast of Belsen, is marched to his death at gunpoint following his trial. His cousin William Miller, 63, who has written a biography about the late solicitor, said: 'Cecil couldn't talk about his Belsen experience in later life without tears streaming down his face because of the traumatic memories. 'He never publicised his extraordinary war record but I am very proud of it - it must rate as the most important legal work of his career.' Prosecutor: Mr Hamilton-Miller served in India for much of World War II and arrived in Bergen-Belsen shortly after its liberation in May 1945 . Bergen-Belsen was a Nazi concentration camp in Lower Saxony, Germany. It was initially intended to hold prisoners of war, but in 1943, parts of the camp became a 'transit camp' for, mainly Jewish, civilian prisoners, . The camp became the final resting place of some 20,000 prisoners of war and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and disabled, and was is burned to the ground after its liberation by British and Canadian troops in April 1945. After qualifying as a solicitor in 1935, Cambridge educated Mr Hamilton-Miller was enlisted into the Territorial Army in 1936 and then, in 1939, was granted an emergency commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the Border Regiment. For much of the war he served in India, until in 1944 he returned to Britain on leave and was posted to Carlisle. This ended abruptly on April 15, 1945 when the 11th Armoured Division of the British Army liberated Bergen-Belsen. Recognising that the liberated camps on the continent would require military lawyers, Mr Hamilton-Miller was among those immediately posted immediately to the British Liberation Army, 49 Reinforcement Holding Unit, where he was appointed Staff Captain to 21 Army Group HQ, War Crimes Investigation Team, arriving at Belsen sometime after May 5 to a horrific, challenging and distressing scene. Mr Hamilton-Miller's role appears to have been to assist Major Savile Geoffrey Champion, head of No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Unit, Belsen, to prepare the legal cases against the SS camp personnel. Mr Miller added: 'Cecil's team opened a war crimes investigation office inside the camp and files were opened on each guard. 'Gradually written witness statements and other evidence built up in each file enabling decisions to be made as to whether and when the case against each guard was sufficiently clear and strong to progress to trial.' The first Belsen trial began on September 17, 1945, at Luneburg Town Hall and took the form of a Military Tribunal. Up in smoke: Bergen-Belsen, which became the final resting place of 20,000 POWs and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and people with disabilities is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 . The trial of the prison guard, called Rothe, who killed a young girl by beating her was sentenced to ten years in prison. Mr Hamilton-Miller was also responsible for the camp commandant Kramer, the doctor, Dr Klein, and nine guards, being sentenced to death by hanging. Nineteen guards were sentenced to prison terms of between life and one year, with most of them having to serve between ten and 15 years. Mr Miller added: 'Many inmates at Belsen had been moved hurriedly from Auschwitz, and Cecil's unit took evidence from witnesses against Nazi criminals such as Dr Mengele, guards responsible for selecting people to go to the gas chambers, as well as conducting horrific medical experiments on them. 'Cecil appears to have remained in the Belsen posting until December 1945 after which he was sent home and demobbed.' Upon his return to the UK, Mr Hamilton-Miller re-qualified as a solicitor and married Sylvia Hurle. The pair lived in Glastonbury, Somerset, where Cecil lived for the majority of his life, becoming Mayor of the city in 1969. After his wife's death Cecil moved to family in Norwich before his death in 2001 aged 91.\",\n",

The Latvian firm is currently developing a one megawatt electric race car to compete in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in June. The stomach-churning vehicle, dubbed eO PP03, runs on 50 kWh lithium-ion battery pack driving six YASA-400 electric motors. Latvia-based Drive eO has created a vehicle, named eO PP03, which runs on 50 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that drives six YASA-400 electric motors and produces 1020 kW (1368 horsepower) It is capable of producing 1020 kW (1368 horsepower) and speeds of up to 160 mph (260 km/h), compared to the top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h) on the Model S. Drive eO says it will be the 'first one megawatt all-electric race car with peak torque of 2160 Nm and kerb weight is targeted at 2646lb (1,200kg). The car is still in development and the company has yet to reveal its range. 'We want to become the first overall winner with an electric vehicle,' said Kristaps Dambis, project director at Drive eO. Drive eO was the first to enter and complete the Dakar Rally with a hybrid electric vehicle. That was followed by the creation of eO PP01, a purpose built fully electric prototype race car to participate at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb competition. The one megawatt electric race car is set to compete in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (pictured) in Colorado Springs. The race is the second oldest motor racing event in the US and runs on a challenging 12.42 mile (20km) course with 156 turns in Colorado Springs. All wheel drive .

The announcement of the Drive eO PP03 following the development of software upgrades to make the P85D even faster. 'Tesla P85D 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0.1 sec soon via over-the-air software update to inverter algorithm,' Tesla founder Elon Musk tweeted earlier this year. Musk was referring to something known as the 'insane mode' which allows the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 in a little over three seconds. The D model, unveiled in October has two motors - one powering the front wheels and one powering the rear wheels. It has a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h), compared with the current 130 mph (209 km/h) on Tesla's previous S model. In Insane Mode, the full 691 horsepower of the electric car's two motors is applied in one go. At the launch event, Mr Musk said the car reaches 60mph in three seconds from a standstill. During recent tests of the Insane acceleration, also carried out by DragTimes, the car achieved the speed in 3.17 seconds .\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Aaron Hernandez looked full of promise in his 2007 high school yearbook picture . Aaron Hernandez was  a rapidly rising star in the NFL. He was a key part of the New England Patriots offense, played in the Super Bowl and had signed a massive five-year contract extension that would pay him nearly $40million. He had a baby girl, a beautiful fiancee and an expansive $1.5million mansion in the Boston suburbs. But even before the murder of Odin Lloyd in June 2013 - a crime for which he will now spend the rest of his life in prison - Hernandez was not the golden boy he seemed to be. His arrest for Lloyd's murder was not the beginning of his criminal career - but rather just the first time he's been held accountable for his actions. Hernandez has been accused of shooting a total of six men - killing three and severely wounding three other. Two of them, Lloyd and a man who says Hernandez shot him through the eye, were supposedly the star's friends. After his father died, he had no one in his life to keep in on the straight and narrow. That, combined with his desire to be involved in the 'thug life' on the streets in his hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, and escalating drug and alcohol use set the stage for the murders, family and friends have said. Scroll down for video . Hernandez was captain of his high school football team and rated as the best football player in the state of Connecticut in his senior year . Hernandez, seen here in a candid shot from his senior yearbook at Bristol Central High School, grew into a troubled, and very powerful, young man . Add into it, a history of escaping trouble thanks to coaches and cops allegedly covering for him. He had had at least three major run-ins with the law prior to his murder arrest - and managed to escape without charges every time. The 25-year-old made it out of a tough neighborhood in Bristol, Connecticut, but never seemed to leave the streets behind. A 2013 Rolling Stone\\xa0article claimed that he maintained gang affiliation - and even allegedly got a Bloods gang tattoo - even after making millions in the NFL. As his career wore on, he became more distant from his family and closer with his alleged gang friends, Rolling Stone claimed. Additionally, he became increasingly paranoid and carried a gun everywhere he went. Rolling Stone claims he also began smoking the hallucinogen PCP, or angel dust. A family friend told the magazine that Lloyd's murder was a result of Hernandez's drug abuse. 'Don’t matter what it’s about: Aaron’s out of his mind. He’s been twisted on dust now for more than a year, which is when all of this crazy s*** started.' The magazine accuses Hernandez of being involved in a 'thug life' that was apparent even to New England head coach Bill Belichick. When he was arrested he was only 'one step' from being cut from the team over the issues, it was claimed. A friend told Rolling Stone that Hernandez chose to surround himself with a 'crew' of so-called gangsters, rather than hanging out with his team mates or other athletes. 'One of his uncles went to Boston to talk to him, and these scary-looking dudes are hanging out in his game room. They wouldn’t say hi or shake his hand, and when he brought it up to Aaron, he laughed him off,' a friend told the magazine. Star: Aaron Hernandez played in the Super Bowl as a key piece of the New England Patriots offense in 2012 . Hernandez was a star high school player from a bad neighborhood in Bristol, Connecticut. He revered his father Dennis Hernandez, who was himself a local sports legend - and also a  petty criminal as a teen. According to former coaches from Bristol, Dennis kept his son on the straight-and-narrow. When his father died in January 2006 from complications from a routine surgery, Aaron  became withdrawn. 'It was very, very hard, and he was very, very angry,' his mother Terri told USA Today. 'He wasn’t the same kid, the way he spoke to me. The shock of losing his dad, there was so much anger.' When Aaron's father died, his mother Terri moved her new husband into the family house. According to police reports, the new husband was violent and physically abused Terri. Jeffrey Cummings was also a convicted drug dealer. In July 2010, he allegedly stabbed Terri Hernandez during a fight. Following the death of his father, as a 17-year-old senior, Hernandez was named as the best football player in Connecticut. Also in Bristol, he met his longtime partner and future mother of his young daughter, Shayanna Jenkins. She has continued to stand by the troubled star - even enduring arrest for perjury for refusing to disclose exactly about what happened following Lloyd's murder. In 2006, an offer to play football for the University of Florida Gators  on scholarship seemed like a fresh start. Coach Urban Meyer helped counsel him during his time there and even assigned Tim Tebow to look after him. Hernandez scored one the Patriots' two touchdowns during Super Bowl XLVI in 2012 .

In 2009, he helped lead the team to a national championship. But problems began to emerge as well. In April 2007 as a 17-year-old freshman, Hernandez ordered two drinks at a Gainesville, Florida, bar then refused to pay. When a waiter escorted him outside, the football star waited until his head was turned then allegedly punched him in the head, bursting his eardrum. Police were called and recommended that Hernandez be charged with felony assault. Meyer, Florida's legendary football coach, intervened and no arrest was ever made, according to Rolling Stone. That same year he was also questioned in connection with a drive-by shooting in which two men were shot, one in the head, following a fight over a gold necklace with Florida Gators football players at a nightclub. He was never charged and no one was ever arrested. Shayanna Jenkins, seen here in her 2007 yearbook picture, met Hernandez in high school . In 2008, he was suspended from the first game of the year for testing positive for marijuana. Rolling Stone claims that his drug violations may have been even more pronounced and that he failed more drug tests than the one that was released publicly. Following those incidents, he seemed to turn a corner.\\xa0He was drafted in 2010 in the fourth-round by the Patriots. Many scouts said his talent merited a first-round pick, but teams were so concerned about his off-the-field behavior and connections to street gangs that they refused to draft him. His return to New England after being drafted by the Patriots allowed him to reconnect with the bad influences from his childhood, friends have said. On the Patriots, he made massive impact on the field. He quickly became one of quarterback Tom Brady's favorite targets. In three seasons, he scored 18 touchdowns and had nearly 2,000 yards receiving. In February 2012, he appeared in Super Bowl XLVI and caught a 12-yard pass from Brady for a touchdown. In 2012, the Patriots signed their star to a 5-year, $37.5million contact that included more than $12.5million in signing bonuses. In June 2012, he went to Los Angeles with his fiancee Shayanna Jenkins. While there, police were called to his apartment on a domestic violence call after neighbors dialed 911. When cops arrived, Hernandez was dismissive and Sayanna made it clear that she didn't want to press charges, so they left. On July 16, 2012 Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, who immigrants from Cape Verde, were found murdered in their car in South Boston following a drive-by shooting. They had reportedly gotten into a fight with Hernandez and his crew at a night club prior to their murders. In May 2014, prosecutors indicted Hernandez for both killings. He still faces trial on those murders. On the same month that Lloyd was murdered, a former friend filed a lawsuit against Hernandez claiming the NFL star had shot him in the mouth in February 2013 following a fight at a Miami strip club. The man, Alexander Bradley, lost his eye in the shooting and subsequently testified against Hernandez at his murder trial. In February 2014 - following his arrest for murder - he was allegedly involved in a jailhouse fight and for threatening a jail guard. He was later indicted on those charges and faces trial for them, as well.\",\n",

However, this did not appear to cross the mind of teenager Lily Sharp, who lives in the UK, when she decided to prank her own mother. Rather than put a whoopie cushion on her chair or balance flower on top of a door, Lily decided to amuse herself by faking her own kidnapping- any parents worse fear. As mean-spirited as the joke appeared, Lily certainly took the steps in order to make the prank as convincing as possible. Scroll down for video . Lily Sharp perhaps took a joke too far after convincing her own mother she had been kidnapped . She began by texting her mother a seemingly innocent message: 'You didn't tell me the decorator man was coming mate!' Before adding in a quick reference from the famous Liam Neeson kidnapping film Taken. She continued: 'I thought I was guna get taken man. Thought he was tryna trick me into getting into the house' (sic) before adding, 'Not happy young lady.' Lily began her prank by convincing her mother that she had allowed a stranger to enter their home . She then took the prank a step further by pretending to her panicked mum that the intruder had her phone, informing her mother that the kidnapper would require £4000 for her return . Her suspicious mother replies immediately with: 'Whaaaat? What decorator?!?!! Call me. There is no decorator.' Lily then plays on her mother's fears by pretending that the intruder now has possession of the phone simply replying: 'She knows that now.' At this point Lily's mother is completely fooled and has become more frantic insisting that her daughter calls her immediately. 'Who knows it!! Call me please' she replies before adding, 'Now' After her mother reveals that she is sending the police round Lily reveals that it was all a trick . She convinces her mother by sending a picture of herself, her mother does not find it amusing . At this point many would have called their panicking parent however Lily decides to take it up a notch. 'My name is Victor' she replies before demanding a ransom 'I have your child. I want £4000 to get her back.' Lily's mother tries to keep calm texting back: 'Sending a neighbour round now' But Lily simply insights more panic in her mother when she replies: 'Good luck with that. I've already gone. She's with me.' At this point Lily's mother informs who she believes to be the intruder that she has called the police: 'Ok well police will be.' Lily attempts one more cheeky text as the intruder with 'She says hello' before revealing that it was all a trick. She then reassures her mum by sending a picture of herself perched on their sofa. Predictably the mother does not take this well ending the conversation by swearing at her daughter. Although her mother may not have found the joke funny, after posting a photo of the messages on Twitter, Lily received 18,000 retweets and 25,000 favourites.\",\n",

The 37-year-old is feared to have drowned while on holiday in Laos after a tourist boat she was travelling in hit a rock and sank in the Mekong river . A body has been recovered in the search for a missing BBC worker, who is feared to have drowned while on a dream holiday in\\xa0south east Asia. Johanna Powell, a picture editor working for BBC Wales, was reported missing on Saturday\\xa0after a cruise boat she was in hit a rock and sank 'within a minute'. The 37-year-old was sailing on a traditional wooden cruise boat along the Mekong river in Laos with three friends when it hit a rock in a stretch of rapids. The crew, tour guide and other passengers - including her friends - all swam to safety, but Ms Powell, from Cardiff, disappeared in the strong current. Rescuers launched a massive search along 20km of the river to try and find her, in one of the most isolated parts of the\\xa0country. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) confirmed a body has been found, but it has not yet been identified. A BBC Wales spokeswoman said: 'We are aware that a body has been found in the area where Jo went missing following a boating incident on Saturday. 'Our thoughts remain with her family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time.' Ms Powell - who combined working at the BBC with helping to run a hotel - was in the country as part of a three-week holiday, starting in Bangkok. One of her group was marking their 40th birthday . Ms Powell was travelling on a boat like this along the Mekong river, when it hit a rock in a stretch of rapids. While the rest of the passengers and crew managed to swim to safety, she disappeared under the water . A spokesman for BBC Wales, where Ms Powell worked as a picture editor, said they were 'very concerned' about their missing colleague. The Foreign Office confirmed a British national has been reported missing . They spent Friday night on the chartered\\xa0boat, and had an overnight stay at the DP guesthouse in the village of Pakbeng. The boat set sail at 8am on Saturday,\\xa0before the accident happened at 9.30am. Passengers on the trip are not required to wear life-jackets and one survivor said the water was very rough 'like a washing machine'. 'It was terrifying. We all thought we were going to die', she added. Her brother-in-law Dean Price said the family was told she was asleep when the boat hit a rock in rapids causing it to tip, take on water and capsize, said the BBC. The tragedy happened in a remote part of Laos in the Mekong river, pictured. \\xa0Emergency services in the country have now launched a massive search, covering 20km of the river, to try and find missing Ms Powell . A work colleague described Cardiff resident Ms Powell, 37, as 'lovely, outgoing and always smiling' Adisak Star, the co-owner of cruise company Negi of Mekong that owned the boat, said they did not know what happened to her. He said: 'Ms Powell was travelling with three women friends who have all been accounted for. 'The boat which has a steel bottom but is otherwise made of wood hit a rock in the rapids and sank in a minute. It was that fast. 'Everyone on board went into the water but there were rocks for people to cling to. 'They were all able to get to the river bank except for Ms Powell.' Friends in Cardiff are taking care of her dog called Agatha Christie. A work colleague, who asked not to be named, paid tribute to the University of East Anglia graduate, saying: 'She is lovely, outgoing and always smiling. 'She had been looking forward to the trip for a long time.' After the accident her friends and the other survivors were taken to Luang Prabang and have been flown to Vientiane where they were being dealt with by consular officials. The owner of the cruise company whose boat sank while Ms Powell was a passenger vowed they would not give up looking for her. The survivors of the accident clung to rocks on the Mekong river to help keep afloat . Alex Chitdara, co-owner of rival company Shompoo Cruise said the accident happened on a very isolated stretch of the Mekong river. 'There are few roads and no telephones or mobile phone signal', he said. 'The water level is low, you have to know what you are doing to get a boat that big through the rapids.'\",\n",

In both 2012 and 2014 Stoll headed to the MGM Grand to celebrate at the end of the hockey season. It seems that Stoll went on a date with Andrews on Thursday night, as she posted a photo of a romantic-looking candle that was seemingly taken at Italian restaurant La Sosta Enoteca in Manhattan Beach, California, on her Instagram page, and a fan snapped a photo with Stoll earlier in the day.

Many believed that he was 'hurt' by the show and it was a factor in the 65 year old's decision to take his own life. 'Fredric was a dear friend but he was also very vain and to be parodied this way must have hurt,' said Edith Newman, a friend for 30 years. 'It would have had an affect on his thinking.

More than 200 friends, family and former patients attended the hour-long service overseen by Rabbi Tom Heyn. Mourners leaving the memorial were split over whether the TV show made by Hollywood star Tina Fey was a factor in the suicide. Many of the women at the service were walking adverts for the man known affectionately as the 'Baron of Botox'. One woman in her 60s said: 'We will never know if the show pushed him over the edge. No one had any idea that he was depressed. It is just so sad.' Another, who did not want to be named, added:'He was obviously depressed and when that happens minor things take on a bigger significance.

Abandoned: The 22-year-old was just 20 months old when the Nirvana frontman committed suicide, which she describes as being \\'abandoned in the most awful way possible\\' \\'I would have felt more awkward if I\\'d been a fan,\\' she said. \\'I was around 15 when I realized he was inescapable.

The visual artist also revealed that her fathers ex bandmates Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear get the \\'K.C.

And I don’t promote having a fix-it baby, which is what I was - to fix their problems. \\'But I know from the video footage and letters that I have that Kurt wrote me... my dad did love me.\\' Spooky: The visual artist said she gave Kurt\\'s ex Nirvana bandmates the \\'KC Jeebies\\' when they see her, because they are \\'looking at a ghost\\'',\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Our young Earth may have collided with a body similar to the planet Mercury, says a new paper. The dramatic event could explain why our planet has a hot core that gives it its magnetic field. And it could also explain why certain rare-earth elements in Earth’s mantle do not seem to originate from the planet’s other building blocks - meteorites. Oxford scientists say a Mercury-like body struck the young Earth (artist's illustration shown). The object would have been the heat source for our planet's core. The same object could have been responsible for creating the moon. It also explains where some rare-Earth elements came from . The study, by two scientists from the University of Oxford, was published in the journal Nature. Our current theory of Earth’s formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. However, this model cannot explain where the heat source for Earth’s core - and ultimately its magnetic field - came from. In addition, Earth’s crust and mantle appear to have a higher ratio of the rare-earth elements samarium and neodymium than most meteorites - suggesting there was more at play in Earth’s formation than first thought. To address this discrepancy, scientists believe that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars - but like Mercury in its composition - early in its life. This likely would have happened about 4.5 billion years ago. The body would have been rich in sulphur but very poor in oxygen - just like Mercury. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. But one mystery has persisted, revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition? Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon. Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon. Or Theia could have, coincidentally, been isotopically similar to young Earth. A third possibility is that the moon formed from Earthen materials, rather than from Theia, although this would have been a very unusual type of impact. Our current theory of Earth’s (left) formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. Now scientists think that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars, but like Mercury (right) in its composition, early in its life. In the young solar system 4.5 billion years ago, illustrated, various planetesimals and other small bodies coalesced together to form larger bodies like Earth . As it collided with Earth, it would have produced radioactive uranium and thorium, generating the heat needed to drive the ‘dynamo’ of molten iron in Earth’s core. And they do not rule out the possibility that this is the same Mars-sized body that formed the moon. ‘We think that that is quite conceivable,’ said study co-author Bernard Wood, reported the LA Times. ‘It's kind of exciting to think that this reduced body could actually be the thing which caused the moon.’ In an accompanying News and Views article for Nature, Dr Richard Carlson of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC said the theory could open up new avenues for thought.. For example, if true, it would raise further questions about ‘how Earth ended up in its present oxidised state, which it has apparently retained for more than three billion years.’\",\n",

Terry McCarty was just six years old when he was engulfed with flames after his brothers filled a bowl with kerosene which was set alight and accidentally knocked on to him. The 29-year-old, from Hawthorne, Nevada, endured 58 operations as well as cruel taunts from bullies who called him Freddy Krueger because of the scars on his face, body and arms. But he was determined to overcome the harrowing experience that had crippled his confidence for years. Form victim to hero: Terry McCarty was just six years old (left) when he suffered third-degree burns to 70 per cent of his body in a childhood accident. He has now overcome his terrible injuries and cruel taunts from bullies by becoming a firefighter (right) after refusing to let 'fear take over my life' Endured 58 operations: Terry McCarty aged six with his mother Nancy. He was engulfed with flames after his brothers filled a bowl with kerosene which was set alight and accidentally knocked on to him . He said: 'After the accident I lived in a constant state of fear and uncertainty. 'I struggled to find work as an adult as people always told me I was a liability, and I had started to believe it. 'Becoming a fireman was a spur of the moment decision - I thought if I could do this, people would realise I could do anything.' Mr McCarty applied to a Washington fire service in October 2011. After his application was accepted in April 2012, he faced 12 weeks of gruelling training, where he confronted fire for the first time since his accident. 'If I could do this, people would realise I could do anything': Terry McCarty in his bunker gear aged 26 (left) and 27 (right). He applied to the fire service in October 2011 and passing his training in July the following year . He said: 'As part of my training I had to complete a live fire exercise, where fire is made using propane in an artificial setting. 'Fear washed right over me, just as the fire had all those years ago. 'I couldn't move, I felt like I was six years old again when I saw those flames shooting out of the ceiling. 'But I think it helped. In the end - I started to realise the fire didn't control me. Why should I let fear take over my life?' In July 2012, having passed his training, Mr McCarty won the admiration and respect of his colleagues and the public. He said: 'Attending events, or even just being out in public in my uniform, always attracted a mixture of shocked and awed reactions.' Agony: Terry McCarty aged six (left) and (right) after undergoing skin grafts aged seven. He suffered cruel taunts from bullies who called him Freddy Krueger because of the scars on his face, body and arms . Always there for him: Terry McCarty at his homecoming aged 16 with his father and brother Ryan . Mr McCarty lost part of his fingers and thumbs in the accident and had to teach himself how to quickly put on his uniform and air tank and properly brace himself with his hip when using a hose. Having spent two years as a firefighter, he quit the force to work with the Burned Children Recovery Foundation at Camp Phoenix, a programme in Bellingham, Washington, supporting children with burns. He said: 'Fire robbed me of my childhood - I wanted to give these children a chance to experience being a kid, even for a short time.' After his accident in 1992, he was placed in a medically-induced coma for two months at Shriners Hospital in Galveston, Texas. Mr McCarty was hospitalised for 12 months and remembers this time vividly, including the debridement process of scrubbing off his burned skin, and multiple skin grafts. He said: 'It was absolutely terrifying. I didn't understand anything - all I knew was that when I saw a doctor, I should expect pain. 'I'd be taken out of surgery just long enough to stabilise and then I'd be rushed back in.' Brave: Mr McCarty lost part of his fingers and thumbs in the accident and had to teach himself how to quickly put on his uniform and air tank and properly brace himself with his hip when using a hose . Terry McCarty shows off his nickname 'Char King' which he got tattooed onto his arm . After a year of recovery, he returned to school at the age of eight, where he became the victim of bullies who would call him 'monster', 'toast' and 'Freddy Krueger'. He said: 'The one thing that got me through was the love of my family - especially my brothers, Ryan and Jason. 'There was never any anger between us, and I don't know what I would've done without them.' He and his brothers became inseparable and with their encouragement and support he found the courage to stop hiding himself, and accept the stares and comments. He said: 'The emotional bond we had was vital to my recovery - they did so much for my confidence by just being there.' Apart from the scarring and damage to his hands, he suffered no major health issues as a result of the burns, and quickly adjusted to moving with his tighter skin. He is now focusing on opening his own foundation to fund programmes for children with burns. Although he has no immediate plans to return to firefighting, he hopes his foundation, which will focus on fundraising, will provide the financial support needed for other foundations that offer firefighting experience. Mr McCarty, now of Bellingham, Washington, said: 'Nothing like this programme has been done before. 'It's going to take a lot of work, but being able to support people who suffered like I did will make it all worthwhile.'\",\n",

The steam is forced out of the generator through a hose into the iron, shooting out at 90g per minute — twice as fast as conventional steam irons (think of the difference in power between jet-washing and using a hosepipe) — cutting through creases quicker. As well as being more powerful, it also produces twice as much steam, making shorter work of wrinkles. On the downside, despite the investment, you get only a two-year guarantee. 3/5 . PRECISION PERFECT . Philips Easy Speed Plus, £29.50, amazon.co.uk . The big selling point of this pretty aqua blue iron is the precision tip, which means you can get really sharp creases flat with minimum elbow grease, making it perfect for shirts and trousers. I also love the vertical steam option, which means you can smooth creases from hanging fabrics, such as curtains, by holding the iron vertically 2 in away and pressing the steam button. Steam output is 35g per minute — with a boost function of up to 120g to blast at stubborn creases. Impressive for the price. 4/5 . BARGAIN BUY . Swan Steam Iron SI1001ON, £19.99, argos.co.uk . This does an adequate job and you get a lot for your money — including a generous 350ml water tank and variable steam control, which means you can opt for continuous steam at 40g per min or a 140g per minute shot of steam. But it’s so heavy, at 1.3kg, that I’m in danger of developing muscles like Popeye if I keep using it. And while the dolphin-shaped nose helps me reach tricky areas, such as around shirt buttons, it makes the iron look downright ugly. I also found the soleplate scaled up quickly. 2/5 . POWER HOUSE . Braun TexStyle 7 TS755, £49.99, johnlewis.com . This looks like a fighter jet, and is so heavy (1.3kg empty and 1.65kg when the water tank is full) it makes ironing even more of an effort. On the plus side, the ergonomic handle is easy to hold. I also like the way the cable is 2.5m long — useful if you can’t get near a plug. It’s impressively powerful. Steam shoots out at 50g per minute and the precision shot also releases steam at 170g per minute. 3/5 . LIGHTWEIGHT PRO . Russell Hobbs Autosteam Pro Iron, £19.99, argos.co.uk . One of the cheapest irons I tried, this is beautifully lightweight at 1.14kg despite having a large 320ml water tank. There are lots of functions such as a non-stick soleplate and a vertical steam option. You also get a generous two-metre cord. But it falls down on the one job I’m paying for — ironing. Although it is supposed to be non-drip, it leaked at low temperatures and left unsightly marks on my silk shirt. 2/5 . VALUE FOR MONEY . Philips PerfectCare Pure Steam Generator, £119.99, robertdyas.co.uk . The nearest rival to the Swan iron and less than half the price, this is fantastic value for a top-range model bursting with extras. I normally dread ironing my grandmother’s thick linen table cloth, but I removed every crease in seconds with no effort. It’s all thanks to the impressive 1.5-litre water reservoir which pumps out high-pressure steam at 110g per minute. And the soleplate is designed so steam is distributed evenly — meaning fewer strokes and speedy ironing. The manufacturer boasts that you never need to change the settings as it creates the perfect temperature level whether you are ironing silk PJs or kids’ jeans. I tried it — and it was true. You also get a five-year guarantee. 5/5 . CORDLESS POWER . Tefal Freemove FV9970, £79.99, johnlewis.com . Tefal is hugely proud of its cordless iron. And with good reason. The base recharges the iron during each rest period, which means there is no cord getting in your way, and the control panel lets you know when you need to recharge. It’s powerful, too — delivering an impressive 180g per minute shot of steam. The handy steam on-demand trigger got rid of stubborn creases in my partner’s shirts. It also has a vertical steam option. I used it to blast away creases in a dress that had been hanging in my wardrobe for too long — much easier than dragging out the ironing board. If you’re happy to pay over the odds to dispense with a cord, this is a great option. 3/5 . TURBO STEAM . Tefal Ultimate Anti-Calc FV9603, £69.99, argos.co.uk . Lots of impressive features here — such as a unit which collects all the limescale from your iron. A turbo steam function delivers a mighty 200g per minute jet of steam and an anti-drip mechanism cuts down on the chances of water leaking. But this iron is too darn heavy: a stonking 1.5kg when empty; once the 350ml tank is full, it’s like lifting a brick. On the plus side, it provides the perfect excuse to hand over the ironing to my partner. 3/5 .',\n",

Jams in Warr Acres, Oklahoma, noticed that someone had been looking for food in the bins behind her restaurant and decided try and get in contact with them. She taped a sign to her diner window appealing to the person to come forward, so that she could give them a proper meal - free of charge. The notice read: 'To the person going through our trash for their next meal, you're a human being and worth more than a meal from a dumpster.

The owner told News Channel 4 that she hadn't expected it to receive such a huge response and was just trying to do the right thing. She said: 'Last week, I had noticed some bags, when I had taken out the trash, were torn open and some of the food was taken out,' 'That really, it hurt me that someone had to do that - I will not take down that sign until they come in. 'I think we've all been in that position where we needed someone's help and we just needed someone to extend that hand and if I can be that one person to extend that hand to another human being then I will definitely do it.' Thousands of people have since taken to social media to rave about Ashley's actions. Facebook user Lesley Jaquay wrote: 'Imagine if every restaurant did this. So much food goes to waste.

Motaz Zaid, who is currently studying economics at the University of Greenwich, was with a friend in St Marks Close in Parsons Green, south west London, in the early hours of Friday when the group of thugs targeted them. His friend, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the pair were sprayed with ammonia and assaulted with tools before Mr Zaid, 20, was bundled into a Mercedes C220 Estate and driven off. Motaz Zaid was with a friend in  Parsons Green, south west London, in the early hours of Friday when the group of thugs targeted them. Mr Zaid was apparently bundled into a Mercedes by masked men and attacked . The friend, 19, who was stabbed several times in the back and legs during the ordeal, was left for dead in the quiet residential street while Mr Zaid was found dumped a few miles away, close to the A3 on the border of New Malden and Parsons Green. Police became alerted to the incident after spotting the vehicle in Beverley Way, Kingston, at about 1am. Uniformed officers approached the stationary car, but it drove off and fled from the scene despite attempts by police to pursue it. Officers then discovered Mr Zaid dumped on the side of the road with life-threatening injuries. He was taken to a south London hospital, which cannot be named for security reasons, where he remains in a critical condition. His friend was also taken to hospital with stab wounds but was later discharged. The friend recalled the incident today and told the\\xa0Evening Standard: 'They had been parked waiting for him to get back. As we both got out of the car, these five guys just jumped us. They sprayed something in our eyes and it blocked our vision. 'They weren't after me, they were beating him up. I tried to fight them off and to grab him but he was on the floor and not moving. I hit one of them in the face and three of them chased me into the main road and stabbed me. 'By the time I got back to my friend the car had left and I thought he had got away but after looking for him I realised they had taken him in the car.' Mr Zaid, 20, who is currently studying economics at the University of Greenwich, was found dumped at the side of the A3 in\\xa0Beverley Way, Kingston, south west London (above). He remains in hospital with critical injuries . Mr Zaid's father Azz said his son's injuries were 'very serious', adding: 'My heart is broken when I see my son like that. I can't believe anyone could do that to another human being.' He said he believes the incident is in response to a minor altercation last week. He said his son was allegedly involved in an accident with another car, in which one of the vehicles became slightly damaged. He claims the other driver refused to negotiate a settlement and threatened violence if his son did not pay £400. Metropolitan Police said officers from the Trident Gang Crime Command are currently investigating the incident and trying to trace the suspects .

              " {'sequence': \"Father Hamish Baillie (pictured) claims Lord Janner abused him during a game of hide-and-seek in 1983 . A father allegedly abused by Lord Janner has called for the top legal official who decided against prosecuting him to step down. Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, concluded dementia made the 86-year-old unfit to plead. Last night, one of the nine victims who had been lined up to give evidence against the former Leicester West MP waived his right to anonymity to say the decision ‘beggars belief’ – and claimed it points to an establishment cover-up. Hamish Baillie, 47, said he was unable to trust adults after being molested by Lord Janner during a game of hide-and-seek in a park, when he was a 15-year-old resident of a children’s home. But he added that the failure to prosecute the peer for a fourth time – three inquiries were curtailed by police or the Crown Prosecution Service – was a ‘complete travesty’. The father-of-three said he turned to drugs as a result of the abuse, which left him ‘questioning myself and everyone around me’. He believes Lord Janner was ‘steered’ in his direction by the care home’s manager, Frank Beck – a friend who would later be convicted of a string of child sex offences. He added: ‘I don’t think anybody other than the victims and the police involved in the Operation Enamel inquiry understand how perverted a man Lord Janner is. 'He has blighted my life … How can they [the CPS] publicise the fact that there was enough evidence to charge, yet then say it is not in the public interest to pursue it?’ Mr Baillie, of Hinckley, Leicestershire, added: ‘No disrespect to the public, but what about the interest of the victims? ‘As far as I’m concerned, her [Mrs Saunders’s] actions are barely any less perverse than the abuse inflicted upon me as a teenager. She should initiate an inquiry into her own conduct and then step down because Alison Saunders certainly hasn’t been doing her job properly.’ Mr Baillie said the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner (left), \\xa0who he claims abused him when he was aged 15, \\xa0for the fourth time was a 'complete travesty'. Alison Saunders (right) said her job as head of the Crown Prosecution Service was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases, not the most popular ones . He said the police involved in the inquiry were ‘blameless’ but added that ‘when one considers this is the fourth time Janner has been investigated, I honestly think there could be a cover-up at play’. Operation Enamel was set up two years ago and 25 victims accused the Labour peer. Most lived in Leicestershire children’s homes between 1969 and 1988. The CPS last week said the ‘core allegation’ was that Lord Janner befriended Beck to access children ‘to allow him to perpetrate serious sexual offences’ on them. The politician was first implicated during the 1991 trial of Beck, who ran The Beeches children’s home in Leicester. A victim told the court Janner regularly abused him. Beck was convicted of child abuse and rape charges. He died in jail in 1994. Following Beck’s conviction, Lord Janner, then an MP, stood up in the House of Commons to vehemently deny any abuse, and the CPS decided not to take further action. But Mr Baillie, who spent ten months at The Beeches – where he was twice groped by Beck – said he firmly believes the men were acting together to abuse children. He was placed in care aged 15 for ‘rebellious behaviour’ and said he met Lord Janner in 1983 while playing arcade games at Leicester Forest East service station. The peer called him by name, he said, even though ‘I didn’t know him’ and gave him some coins. Mr Baillie said over the next seven months Lord Janner came to the service station seven times, sometimes discussing a hotel where they could go for ‘steak and whisky’. It was amid a game of hide-and-seek in Bradgate Park, Leicestershire, organised by Beck later that year, that he claims he was abused by the peer. ‘I was just moving behind a gorse bush to hide when I saw Greville Janner walking towards me,’ he said. ‘He sat down beside me … Then he abused me. It was indecent touching but he wanted it to go further … It lasted no more than 30 minutes, but it felt like an eternity.’ Mr Baillie believes Beck ‘tipped Janner off about where to find me’. He did not report the abuse to police and only realised who Lord Janner was when he saw the MP’s picture in a newspaper five years later. He added: ‘The fact that Greville Janner has been able to stand up in Parliament and deny abusing children, then carry on with his gilded life is beyond comprehension.’ Legal chief facing growing calls to quit: Backlash against top prosecutor grows as she is accused of ignoring victims and claims of a establishment cover-up . The furious backlash against the UK’s top prosecutor intensified last night over her decision to spare Lord Janner from the dock. The position of Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders looked increasingly fragile as she faced growing calls to stand down. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs accused her of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear the stench of an Establishment cover-up that lingers over the case. And even her one of her predecessors said the horrific allegations should have been resolved in the ‘full public glare of a courtroom’ rather than her London office. Mrs Saunders fought back saying it is her job as the head of the Crown Prosecution Service to make ‘very difficult decisions’ which are not necessarily popular. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs have accused Alison Saunders, the director of the CPS (above), of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear the stench of an Establishment cover-up that lingers overhead . But the row showed no sign of abating as further details of the claims levelled against the 86-year-old Labour life Peer were made public. The decision not to charge Lord Janner last week despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims was justified because Mrs Saunders said experts agreed that the former Leicester West MP was in such poor health due to advanced Alzheimer’s Disease. But she also ruled that he should have been charged three times before in 1991, 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook. The top QC blamed police and prosecutors and launched in independent review, but her comments stoked fears that Lord Janner is the beneficiary of a wholesale cover-up. Yesterday, calls were growing for a judicial review of her decision, something which Leicestershire Police has said it is already considering. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who exposed Cyril Smith, said the weight of criticism against Mrs Saunders suggested something has ‘clearly gone very badly wrong’. He said: ‘Mrs Saunders is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it’s hard to see how her position remains tenable.’ Criticism of Mrs Saunders began with comments from the Home Secretary, who has already been lobbied by senior police chiefs, when she said is ‘very concerned’. Theresa May said: ‘I have been very clear in everything I have said so far about the child sex abuse issue – I expect to see justice done.’ She was joined by former Director of Public Prosecutions Lord Macdonald who said a ‘trial of the facts’ should have been considered. This would have enabled a jury to decide the facts without apportioning guilt and without a sentence being passed – offering a chance for victims to be heard. Lord Macdonald said: ‘It might have been wiser for the CPS to say ‘we’re going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the DPP.’ Further questions also emerged about the true state of Lord Janner’s health as it was revealed he wrote to the House of Lords just a fortnight ago to extend his role. The politician, who has claimed tens of thousands of pounds in expenses in recent years, took a formal leave of absence last October. When asked if he would consider retiring when the election was called, he responded in a personally signed letter received on April 9 asking to continue in office. Experts said victims may now be denied the opportunity to sue Lord Janner because none of the claims have been proven. Richard Kovalevsky QC said: ‘A finding that the acts took place may have consequences for the defendant, particularly one who has the benefit of an honour from the Queen.’ Mrs Saunders has also come under fire over other high-profile cases, including the first disastrous attempt for a conviction for female genital mutilation and the pursuit of journalists.\",\n",

The London Mayor claimed Ukip supporters are in 'increasing psychological conflict' as they realise a vote for Nigel Farage's party is a 'vote for Ed Miliband'. 'A lot want to come home to the Tories. Any gain by Ukip is a gain by Miliband,' he told the Daily Mail as he campaigned in the Thanet South, the Kent seat where Mr Farage is standing. 'The risk is that would let in a Labour/SNP government which would be a catastrophe for the country'. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson receives a kiss on the cheek while campaigning in Finchley High Road and Edgware High Street . Mr Johnson poses for a photo with a group of locals while out on the Tory campaign trail . Two young women take a photo with Mr Johnson while he campaigned on the streets of London yesterday . Mr Johnson also visited Ramsgate, Kent, to support local candidate Craig McKinley . While in Kent, the Mayor of London warned that a vote for Ukip would be equal to a vote for Ed Miliband . Mr Johnson's intervention shows the Tories are determined to ramp up their warnings over a Labour government propped up by the SNP . He also urged Labour and Liberal Democrat voters to rally behind the Conservatives in Thanet and defeat the Ukip leader, an outcome he said would mean Ukip's 'puffball had exploded'. Mr Johnson's intervention signals that the Tories are determined to ramp up their warnings over a minority Labour government dependent on the votes of SNP MPs. Yesterday, former prime minister Sir John Major clashed with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon over the prospect of the surging Scottish Nationalists, on course to win 40 or more seats, holding the balance of power at Westminster. Miss Sturgeon has ruled out any deal with the Conservatives and said she would be prepared to put Mr Miliband in Number Ten even if Labour wins fewer seats in a hung Parliament. In an unusual intervention in contemporary politics, Sir John warned the SNP represents a 'real and present danger' to the future of the United Kingdom. A partnership between Labour and the SNP would mean Mr Miliband being subjected to 'a daily dose of political blackmail' from an SNP determined to 'create merry hell' in order to bring about the end of the Union, he said. His remarks drew a furious response from Miss Sturgeon, who said his remarks about her party being a threat were 'an affront to democracy'. Mr Johnson leaves a walkabout in Ramsgate, Kent, with lipstick on his cheek . 'These are the same politicians that during the referendum campaign urged Scotland to lead the UK not leave the UK. Now they appear to say Scotland's voice should only be heard if we say the things they want us to say and vote the way they want us to vote,' she said. 'My message to John Major is Scotland's voice deserves to be heard in whatever way the Scottish people choose, and voting SNP means Scotland's voice will be heard more loudly and strongly at Westminster than it has ever been heard before.' Former First Minister Alex Salmond insisted Sir John's position was 'fundamentally undemocratic'. He said he was 'the man who, let us remember, rather carelessly mislaid every single Tory seat in Scotland'. 'What these Westminster parties fear - and what many people in England would welcome - is not just the size of the SNP, but the majority for progressive politics that would come from it,' he said . Mr Miliband, who has repeatedly refused to rule out relying on the support of the SNP to get into Downing Street, also reacted angrily. 'David Cameron is setting one part of part of the UK against another. That is dangerous. He is talking up the SNP chances and not taking them on. That is dangerous,' the Labour leader said. 'I have to say to Conservatives, frankly, I think they should tell the prime minister to stop because he is demeaning his office, he is demeaning himself, he is demeaning those people he sends out on his behalf, and frankly, I think it is threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom.' Even one former Tory Cabinet minister expressed unease, claiming the party's campaign attacks on the SNP risk undermining the future of the United Kingdom. Former Scottish Secretary Lord Forsyth said talking up the threat posed by the Scottish nationalists was 'short-term and dangerous'. The Prime Minister was unrepentant last night, rejecting the suggestion he risks stoking SNP support in Scotland. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was mocked by ex-PM Sir John Major over her demand to play a role in propping up a Labour government . Mr Miliband yesterday claimed David Cameron was 'setting up one part of the UK against another' 'I am responsible for lots of things. Heck, I am the prime minister, I am responsible for everything. But I am not responsible for the fact that the Labour Party has failed to get its message across in Scotland. 'The rest of the country does have to wonder, what is the price that they will pay? I fear for our country if this were to happen.' Mr Cameron said the SNP would want voters across the UK to feel by the end of five years of chaotic administration that 'the country doesn't work, that the government does not work, that the country should break up'. Campaigning in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, he added: 'By raising this I am not only raising the issue and the fear that people have that money will be sucked out of areas like this. 'I am also raising the point that we care about our UK, I care passionately about it. Don't let the SNP into government of the UK because they would try to break it up.' Mr Johnson, campaigning in Thanet, said: 'Ukip voters can see the argument that we have got the plan for the economy, and I hope very much that they will think sensibly and carefully. 'There is an element of internal conflict in the minds of many Ukip voters. They are thinking they could end up with something – a backward-looking Labour government propped up by an even more Left-wing SNP – that would really set the country back.' Mr Cameron has repeatedly warned against allowing the SNP into government for fear they will 'try to break it up'\",\n",

That sentiment came true this week when, after 73 years of marriage, William \\'Wild Bill\\' Wilson and his wife Lillian Karr Wilson died just two minutes apart from each other. Both Lillian, 89, and Bill were Alzheimer\\'s patients and for the last couple of years had to live in separate nursing homes. Lillian resided at Richmond Place in Lexington, while Bill stayed at the Thomson-Hood Veterans Center in Wilmore. After 73 years of marriage, high school sweethearts Doug Wilson, 93, and Lillian Kerr Wilson, 89, passed away just two minutes apart from each other this week . But on Tuesday their connection proved strong as ever when one of their sons, Doug, received a phone call at 3.52am to inform him that his father had passed away. Just five minutes later the phone rang again. Doug said it was his mother\\'s nursing home, calling with the same sad news. \\'We all look at it as a blessing,\\' Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader, \\'because we\\'re going to have one funeral for both of them.\\' Doug, 66, believes it will also make it easier for the family to grieve. \\'We’re looking at it as a celebration of life because they had a great life,\\' he told the Washington Post. The couple first met in Corbin, where they were both athletes and high school sweethearts. Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader that his parents ran off to get married and that he doesn\\'t believe \\'either one of them had the blessings of their parents.\\' But that didn\\'t stop the couple, who survived a war and a number of relocations through their long marriage. Bill enlisted in the Army when World War II began. After returning from Germany, he worked and managed various department and retail stores. Doug told the Washington Post that his mother, who he said \\'had great taste\\', could be found working alongside her husband as she designed the showroom windows. The family, which also included Doug\\'s brothers Mike and Terry, hopped around the state and country. There were setbacks along the way. The couple\\xa0unsuccessfully\\xa0tried to open a shopping center in Atlanta and then one of Bill\\'s department stores burned down and couldn\\'t reopen after they moved back to Kentucky. The couple first met in Corbin, Kentucky and, according to their son Doug, ran off and got married without either of their parents\\' blessing. They spent their lives supporting and working alongside each other . But Doug said his parents had a \\'driving force\\' to make sure their three sons received the college education they never got to have. \\'They stressed college so much,\\' Doug said. \\'And they were so proud that they had three sons who had college degrees.\\' And there were successes. After managing a number of stores, Bill decided to open his own realty firm. It grew from an $800 investment into a $1million-dollar company. He would also flip foreclosures, remodeling the houses before putting them back on the market.

Bill was also known for his long-running morning radio show, where he was known as \\'Wild Bill\\' and would organize a number of promotions and contests, including a twist-dancing competition that was so popular the police had to be brought in. The nickname stuck with Bill long after his radio show ended. He was even called \\'Wild Bill\\' at his nursing home, where he would sometimes reenact his show in the cafeteria. Doug said he regularly drove his mother to see her husband at the Veterans center. He said that, although the couple \\'didn\\'t have communication\\', he believes they were \\'reading each other\\' just by having the chance to see each other. When Doug last saw his father the Sunday before his passing, he said Bill was wearing an oxygen mask and was \\'barely hanging on\\'. To comfort him, Doug recited the opening that Bill used to say for every one of his radio shows. \\'I just told him, \"This is Wild Bill Wilson, your red-headed, freckle-faced, snaggle-toothed, snuff-dipping buddy\"\\'. \\'And underneath the mask there, he grinned real big. He heard it. I was glad of that.\\' Friends and family will gather on Saturday evening for a \\'Celebration of life\\' service in honor of the devoted couple.',\n",

              " {'sequence': \"Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor-made for a power-sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon's manifesto\\xa0overlap with Labour policy,\\xa0including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total £180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a ‘strong team’ of SNP MPs in Westminster would help ‘rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected’. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. ‘We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland’s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn’t leave the UK but lead the UK,’ she said. ‘So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland’s voice shouldn’t be heard or that Scotland’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.’ However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today’s launch over her plans for ‘full fiscal autonomy’ or effective ‘home rule’, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a ‘fiscally autonomous’ Scotland would have a £7.6billion black hole in its finances.\",\n",

Fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, said she does not want the accusations tied to Ambra Battilana and her husband to further embarrass their children or interrupt her business, a source told the\\xa0New York Daily News. 'She's furious. She thinks it's embarrassing not only to her but to their kids,' said the socialite who worked with the couple. Weinstein, 63, has emphatically denied sexually assaulting Battilana during a March 27 business meeting at his Tribeca office. The source told the Daily News that Chapman, who has two children with Weinstein, wants to find a resolution to the allegations as soon as possible. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Forlorn: Harvey Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman, 38, stepped out on Friday looking forlorn amid allegations her husband apologized to a 22-year-old model for groping her. He has publicly denied the incident occurred . Downcast: Looking down, Chapman carried the couple's four-year-old daughter India to their car in New York . A second source claimed Chapman, founder of fashion line Marchesa, is humiliated by her husband she married in 2007, and is someone who has 'loved Harry through his charms and flaws,' according to the Daily News. The question remains how much Weinstein is willing to pay to make the situation go away, the source told the newspaper. 'They want her out of the country,' said the socialite source. 'The last thing they need is her popping up at parties and premieres.' But a spokesman for Chapman denied the marriage was in trouble and said they had spent the weekend together. Max Dundas, a long term representative for Chapman, told MailOnline: 'This story is absolutely nonsense. I spoke to Georgina yesterday, they have spent the entire weekend together as a family and their relationship is as strong as ever.' In the meantime, Weinstein is waiting to see if the Manhattan district attorney will decide to seek charges before making his next move, according to the source. Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse on Thursday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police that the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night . Max Dundas, a long term representative for Chapman, told MailOnline: ‘I spoke to Georgina this week, they spent the entire weekend together as a family and their relationship is as strong as ever.' A spokesman for Weinstein also told the Daily News that the idea the allegations were causing a strain on the couple's relationship was 'patently untrue' and that 'whomever is saying it, is lying'. On Saturday the couple were pictured at their Connecticut home. Weinsten was spotted outside the home. Chapman was seen rolling up to the compound in a silver Mercedes-Benz before she went inside. While he has denied the incident occurred, the source dismissed claims that the model had planned the encounter in an effort to land a movie role. As Weinstein fights to throw out the allegations, the\\xa0New York Daily News\\xa0reports that police overheard a phone call between Battilana and Weinstein, in which she confronted him - and he said: 'It won't happen again'. According to a Daily News' source, Weinstein appeared to confirm he groped Battilana during a phone call with the Italian national. 'She said something to the effect that she was uncomfortable with him doing that,' the source told the Daily News. 'And he said something to the effect, 'It won't happen again.'' 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her. The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' Battilana has claimed Weinstein asked her for a kiss and groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night. DailyMail.com has reached out to his representatives for comment. Battilana also convinced Weinstein to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he knew he was being monitored but following the call and the meeting at the restaurant at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, Weinstein voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. Battilana's attorney, David Godosky, said Tuesday is the earliest he expects to hear a decision on whether Weinstein will face criminal charges, according to the New York Daily News. A legal expect told the Daily News that, if the DA decides to prosecute Weinstein, he will likely only face misdemeanor charges. The alleged incident unfolded at Weinstein's Tribeca office after he invited her there for a business meeting on Friday night, hours after meeting her at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night. When she arrived at the office, the married father-of-five allegedly asked if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt, she told police. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. She clearly rejected him and he backed off, the New York Daily News reported, and she fled from the building. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she quickly left the building half an hour after arriving, the newspaper reported. Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with Weinstein, who is behind hit movies including Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech and Gangs Of New York. 'When she was describing what happened, her face became contorted,' said Mark Heller. 'It was that look of someone who was creeped out. She's a very young woman who was relating her disgust that a much older man - an old man in view of someone her age - conducted himself like that.' Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Weinstein's camp have dismissed Miss Battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . It also emerged that she told Italian police in 2010 that she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with €2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. The alleged groping took place on March 27 at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Harvey Weinstein to 'discuss business' After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer  Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004.\",\n",

Delivered in only four minutes via c-section, it is the first time the globe has seen all-girl quintuplets since 1969. As the girls are still building strength, she has only managed to hold two of them so far. But the experience was phenomenal. 'It was an emotional downpour,' she said. 'But that feeling when you finally get to hold your baby, there's no better feeling than that.' Adam admitted the logistics of parenting the five infants, as well as their older daughter Blayke, are still a mystery. 'I'm still getting used to changing them in an incu,' he explained. 'It's pretty overwhelming just because they're so tiny.' Alongside them sat their doctors, who revealed the girls are gearing up for their first breastmilk feeding, which will be a major milestone.

Scientists have shown that using deep brain stimulation (DBS), a technique already used to treat Parkinson's disease, can boost memory by causing new brain cells to be formed. A 'pacemaker' fitted with electrodes is inserted into the brain through holes drilled in the skull. Deep brain stimulation is already used to treat Parkinson's, but now researchers now believe it could be used to improve brain function and ward off diseases such as dementia (file image) Experiments on rats found the therapy improved their powers of recall, and it is hoped the same will apply to humans. The device sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain and has also been shown to provide benefits for a range of conditions including chronic pain, major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. The device was implanted into middle aged rats, sending out minute electrical impulses, and the study found the animals performed better in memory tests compared to those who had not been stimulated, even after 24 hours. Professor Ajai Vyas, of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, said: 'Extensive studies have shown that rats' brains and memory systems are very similar to humans. 'The electrodes are harmless to the rats, as they go on to live normally and fulfil their regular adult lifespan of around 22 months.' DBS is a surgical procedure that has become an established NHS treatment  for Parkinson's sufferers whose condition does not respond to drugs. Tests on lab mice showed improved memory within just 24 hours, while the rodents' life-spans were unaffected (file image) Now the new research, published in the journal eLife, has discovered it could also be used to enhance the growth of brain cells which relieves the harmful effects of dementia related conditions and improves short and long term memory. It found new brain cells, or neurons, can be formed by stimulating the front part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex which is involved in memory retention using minute amounts of electricity. The increase in brain cells reduces anxiety and depression, promotes improved learning, and boosts overall memory formation and retention. Prof Vyas said: 'The findings from the research clearly show the potential of enhancing the growth of brain cells using deep brain stimulation. 'Around 60 per cent of patients do not respond to regular anti depressant treatments and our research opens new doors for more effective treatment options.' Prof Lim Lee Wei, of Sunway University, Malaysia, who worked on the project while he was at Nanyang Technological University, said DBS brings multiple benefits. He said: 'No negative effects have been reported in such prefrontal cortex stimulation in humans and studies have shown that stimulation also produces anti depression effects and reduces anxiety. 'Memory loss in older people is not only a serious and widespread problem, but signifies a key symptom of dementia. 'At least one in 10 people aged 60 and above in Singapore suffer from dementia and this breakthrough could pave the way towards improved treatments for patients.' For decades, scientists have been finding ways to generate brain cells to treat brain trauma and injury, and age related diseases such as dementia. As part of a natural cycle, brain cells constantly die and get replaced by new ones. The area of the brain responsible for generating new brain cells is known as the hippocampus, which is also involved in memory forming, organising and retention. By stimulating the prefrontal cortex, new brain cells are formed in the hippocampus although it had not been directly stimulated.\",\n",

Manuel Garza Jr. received a lethal injection of pentobarbital for killing San Antonio Police Officer John 'Rocky' Riojas in February 2001. He is the sixth convicted murderer to be put to death in Texas this year. The U.S. Supreme Court had refused in November to review his case, and no last-day appeals were filed before his execution. Manuel Garza Jr. was given the death sentence after killing San Antonio Police Officer John 'Rocky' Riojas in February 2001 . Asked to make a final statement, Garza said he was sorry for causing pain to his family, friends and 'especially police officers'. 'Y'all probably hate me,' he said, looking at three friends of his victim, dressed in their navy blue San Antonio police uniforms. He wished them 'peace and love and hope y'all find God like I have and I'll see you on the other side.' As the lethal drug began taking effect, Garza uttered: 'Here it comes!' His voice rose as he said 'Goodbye,' and then he let out a howl that was cut short within seconds as he took three deep breaths, then a couple of shallow ones.\\xa0He was pronounced dead 26 minutes later at 6.40pm. Before his death, Garza was given the same food as the rest of the inmates in his unit for his final meal because Texas no longer allows special-order last meals, according toLast Suppers. He had a grilled pork chop, sweet potatoes, green beans, black beans, cornbread, and peach cake, with a choice of water, tea, or punch to drink. Garza, 35, already had a long criminal record at age 20 when he was stopped by Riojas, who was part of a team targeting property crimes at apartment complexes. Garza ran off and witnesses say that when Riojas caught up with him, the two struggled and Garza grabbed the officer's gun. Riojas, 37, was fatally shot in the head. Witnesses said Garza put Riojas's gun in his pants, cursed at the fallen officer, and ran away. Garza was apprehended a day later at his sister's apartment after an informant told detectives that someone had tried to sell him the officer's missing semi-automatic service weapon. In a statement to detectives, Garza blamed Riojas. 'I truly think this was the cop's fault,' he said. 'I don't see why he wanted to pull out his gun.' Garza said he initially ran because he feared the officer would discover he was wanted on outstanding warrants. 'I didn't want to go to jail,' he said. While being escorted to a holding cell after his arrest, court documents described Garza as cocky and smirking. Riojas (pictured), 37, was part of a team targeting property crimes at apartment complexes. Garza fled when he was stopped by Riojas, which led to a struggle and the police officer's death . He used obscenity-laced language to tell officers they were 'lucky I didn't get y'all... too.' The San Antonio Police Officers Association provided buses for officers to make the 200-mile-trip to Huntsville. Several dozen police officers were outside the prison Wednesday evening, and stood at attention and saluted as Riojas' sister - who also is with the San Antonio department and watched Garza die - and the officer-witnesses emerged. 'We want them to see we do care and the salute is a form of respect,' said Mike Helle, president of the association. But Helle, who was in the same police academy training class with Riojas, said the execution 'doesn't bring back my classmate and my friend.' Defense attorneys had said the shooting was accidental and Garza was a product of childhood neglect and abuse. In a 2013 failed appeal, attorney Michael Gross said Garza's family encouraged him to break the law. His criminal record began at age 14, and included burglaries, thefts, escape from custody and leading police on a stolen car chase. Texas carries out the death penalty more than any other state. Garza was the first inmate executed with a new supply of pentobarbital recently obtained by Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials that would allow his and two other lethal injections scheduled for this month to be carried out. If the other two take place, the state prison agency once again will have to replenish its inventory of the scarce drug or find a new chemical to accommodate at least three more scheduled executions beginning next month. Drug manufacturers, under pressure from death penalty opponents, have been withholding their products for use in capital punishment.\",\n",

A veterinarian has been fired from her clinic after she posted a horrifying image of her holding a cat she had killed by firing an arrow into its head on Facebook. Kristen Lindsey, 31, who lives in Brenham, Texas, allegedly hunted the animal down in her backyard and shot it with a bow, believing it was feral. But a local rescue center say the cat, believed to be called Tiger, was domesticated and had been missing for around two weeks. Beneath the shocking image, Lindsey, a Wyoming native, wrote: 'My first bow kill... lol.\\xa0The only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through it's head. Vet of the year award... gladly accepted.' She also said in a comment, before she learned she no longer had a job: 'And no I did not lose my job. Psshh. Like someone would get rid of me. I'm awesome.' The Colorado State graduate lost her job at the Washington Animal Clinic after the image began circulating online and staff have since been distancing themselves from the former employee. Staff at released a statement on Facebook on Friday saying: 'We are absolutely appalled, shocked, upset, and disgusted by the conduct. 'We have parted ways with Ms. Lindsey. We do not allow such conduct and we condemn it in the strongest possible manner,' the clinic said in the statement.' 'Please know that when informed of this we responded swiftly and appropriately and please do not impute this awful conduct to the Washington Animal Clinic or any of its personnel.' Local prosecutors are now considering whether she should face criminal charges. A Facebook page, called 'justice for the cat murdered by Kirsten Lindsey' \\xa0has already been 'liked' by more than 7,000 people. A video\\xa0of the six-year-old cat that Lindsey is believed to have killed riding on top of a tractor has also surfaced online. Scroll down for video . Lindsey, pictured with her mother Becky, said after the picture was uploaded that she didn't lose her job - claiming no one would fire her because she is 'awesome'. However she later learned she had been fired . Local prosecutors are now considering whether she should face criminal charges. She was also slammed online with a number of people saying she should lose her veterinarian licence . Austin County Sheriff Jack Brandes says he was disturbed by the image. He told KBTX: 'This kind of stuff shouldn't happen in our society,' Brandes said. 'It's a very sad thing. 'Hopefully we will get to the bottom of it and get the truth, 100 per cent truth, and get it to the DA and put it in his hands if it needs to go any further.' The Texas Veterinary Medical Association also condemned her reactions, insisting her conduct does not reflect the standards of other vets. In a statement, they said: 'The Texas Veterinary Medical Association (TVMA) strongly condemns the actions of a veterinarian who claims to have recently shot and killed a feral cat with the use of a bow and arrow. 'The veterinarian, who worked in Brenham, Texas, and is not a TVMA member, posted a picture of herself holding the deceased cat on her personal Facebook page along with some insensitive remarks about the incident. A video of the six-year-old cat that Lindsey is believed to have killed riding on top of a tractor has also surfaced online . The Colorado State graduate lost her job at the Washington Animal Clinic (pictured) after the image began circulating online. She has yet to respond to the image . 'This individual’s actions directly violate the veterinarian’s oath taken to use his or her “scientific knowledge and skills for the benefit of society through the protection of animal health and welfare, the prevention and relief of animal suffering, the conservation of animal resources, the promotion of public health and the advancement of medical knowledge.” 'We are saddened and disturbed by the unfortunate actions of this individual, and we remind Texas residents that this conduct is not reflective of the veterinary profession or of the veterinarians who strive to embody the words of the veterinarian’s oath every day. 'Upon learning of the troubling misconduct, the Brenham clinic where the veterinarian was practicing immediately condemned her actions and terminated her employment. 'The clinic’s ownership and staff have expressed their deepest shock and disgust at such behavior and are regretful that the individual acted in a manner that so drastically deviated from the conduct and values the clinic has upheld in its community for years. 'We hope you will stand strong with us against this type of behavior against animals. TVMA values the trust built between veterinarians and the public based on mutually shared care for animals. The clinic issued a statement confirming Lindsey had been fired and distanced themselves from the employee. They said they were 'disgusted' by her conduct . 'We hope that we can unite to prevent actions like this from occurring in the future. She was also condemned online by a number of people in her profession. Larry Wallace, who said he had been a veterinarian for 40 years, said on Facebook: 'I have never in my long career heard of such an atrocious act by a member of my profession. 'This person most be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 'She took an oath to protect and heal not to killing innocent life. I will be contacting my national association about this matter as she has tarnished the profession for which she has chosen.' Underneath the clinic's statement, Sheilah Christensen wrote: 'She needs to be in jail for animal abuse - follow your state state statutes re animal abuse. Take her license away -- my God, what did she do to the animals in her care at your clinic.' Cruelty to animals is a Class A misdemeanor under penal code 42.092: “A person commits an offense if the person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly tortures an animal or in a cruel manner kills or causes serious bodily injury to an animal.” Lindsey interned at Equine Sports Medicine & Surgery in Weatherford from 2012 to 2013. She created a personal blog called Wyo-Girl-Kristen Lindsey and posted about herself in 2011, saying: 'I love Wyoming and the mountains....the Big Horns especially...but any will do when it really comes down to it. 'I love hunting, fly fishing, pack trips, the outdoors in general, horses, skiing, dancing, whiskey, my friends, my family, God, raising hell, my daddy, and sheep.'\",\n",

Clarkson, 54, who was fired in March after attacking a producer during filming, has not publicly addressed his dismissal, apart from to say that \\'everyone\\'s upset\\'. But the presenter today gave his \\'heartfelt thanks\\' to those who sent their support in the aftermath of his sacking, saying he would \\'miss being there\\'. It came as Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said she would be keen to return to the motoring show if she were invited back. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (left) today revealed he would \\'miss\\' fronting Top Gear, as it emerged that former presenter Angela Rippon (right) would be keen to return to the motoring show . Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said it would be \\'great\\' if she were invited back to front Top Gear . Writing in The Sun, Clarkson said: \\'Heartfelt thanks to all those who have written to say how much they will miss me on Top Gear. It\\'s not as much, however, as I\\'ll miss being there.\\' Clarkson was dropped by the BBC after an internal investigation found he had launched an \\'unprovoked\\' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon because he was offered a plate of cold cuts instead of steak and chips. The presenter was found to have split the producer\\'s lip and verbally abused him. Following weeks of speculation over the star\\'s future, Lord Hall, the director-general of the corporation, publicly announced  that the BBC would not be renewing Clarkson\\'s contract. He said Clarkson had \\'crossed the line\\' and that \\'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another\\'. Now, with the future of the show still up in the air, former newsreader Ms Rippon said it would be \\'great\\' if she was invited back. Clarkson, who was dropped by the BBC after launching an \\'unprovoked\\' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon. today gave his \\'heartfelt thanks\\' to those who have supported him . She told The Daily Mirror: \\'It would be great if they said \"let\\'s get the old girl back to do the odd film for us\". What I did all those years ago is totally different to what they do now. \\'If a programme is going to have longevity, which Top Gear has, it has to keep evolving.\\' She added that there should be a woman included in the team - because half the drivers on the road are female. Jodie Kidd, the former model, has already been linked to the show. It also emerged last month that DIY SOS star Nick Knowles could become the new Top Gear presenter because the BBC believe he is a \\'safe pair of hands\\'. Meanwhile, BBC bosses are said to be desperately trying to hold onto James May (left) and Richard Hammond (right) - Clarkson\\'s co-presenters - for the BBC2 show . Mr May has previously said that the trio \\'came as a package\\', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked \\'the end of an era\\' But BBC bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade Richard Hammond and James May to continue with the show, in a bid to cling onto long-term fans. Although May, 52, and Hammond, 45, have both hinted separately that they do not see a future with Top Gear, both have remained silent on the issue for the past few weeks. A source told the Daily Mirror: \\'Richard is a TV presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he\\'s been on the show a bit longer than James. That is a big opportunity to pass over.\\' They added: \\'It would be a great shame to lose all the talent in one go - re-booting it from scratch would be a far harder task than replacing one.\\' Mr May has previously said that the trio \\'came as a package\\', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked \\'the end of an era\\'. But little has been said since the initial reaction to the sacking. Some believe the presenters are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to sign up the group as a trio. All three were on the cusp of signing new three-year deals when the Clarkson fracas unfolded. Some believe the pair are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to snap up the former Top Gear group as a trio . The day after Clarkson\\'s sacking, May gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to Top Gear, suggesting he is to ‘go back to normal life.’ The presenter admitted he was already considering what to do next with his life - and suggested he might even ditch cars to become a teacher. He said: \\'I might want to do something completely different with my life, I\\'m quite old now. (I might do) something outside of cars, I always wanted to be a teacher.\\' He also seemed to confirm speculation that he would leave the top-rating programme, saying: \\'We always knew it wasn\\'t going to last forever\\'. Clarkson, 54, was sacked after attacking Oisin Tymon in an episode which Lord Hall said had \\'crossed the line\\' But the BBC\\'s creative director Alan Yentob previously made it clear he wanted May and Hammond to continue presenting the show without Clarkson, despite acknowledging it would be \\'perfectly natural\\' for them to have reservations about continuing. He said: \\'It\\'s perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached. \\'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what\\'s going on and where they think the programme needs to be.\\' May fronts several other TV programmes, including the popular James May\\'s Toy Stories, James May\\'s Man Lab and Oz and James\\' Big Wine Adventure with wine expert Oz Clarke. Hammond has a successful career as a children’s television host, fronting the second series of National Geographic\\'s Science of Stupid. He also hosted BBC1’s physical game show Total Wipeout and the CBBC series Blast Lab before they were axed. Clarkson, May and Hammond are scheduled to take part in the live Top Gear shows next month. But the shows have been renamed, without BBC branding. Earlier this month North Yorkshire Police said that following an investigation Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel. Clarkson pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You, which was due to be filmed next week, and aired a day later. It would have marked his first BBC appearance since the fracas which led to his departure.',\n",

Daphne\\'s career originally began  in 1949 and she once told the Express: \\'Modelling was respectable then so my parents were very happy for me to do it and it was fabulous. \\'I still think the Fifties was the best time to be a model because the clothes were so lovely.

She revealed that she keeps her grey hair, which is brushed down around her shoulders in the new campaign, long because it is cheaper. She said: \\'My hair is long now because it’s cheaper, I don’t have to do anything, but put it in a topknot or a French pleat. \\'It avoids that old lady permed look, lengthens the neck and lifts the face.

              " {'sequence': \"Councils are pocketing thousands in change by forcing drivers to overpay for parking\\xa0because their meters  do not accept five or 10 pence coins brought in three years ago. Town halls   have failed to recalibrate some of the 100,000 ticket machines in the UK - making it impossible for drivers to pay the exact cost of parking. In Manchester, where 240 machines are still not upgraded, motorists\\xa0without old-style coins\\xa0must use £1 and two 20p pieces for a typical £1.25 hour's parking - handing the council a 15p profit. Big profit:\\xa0Town hall bosses in Manchester have been accused of pocketing thousands of pounds extra from 240 parking ticket machines in the city because they still do not accept new 5p and 10p pieces . The council also charges £1.85 for an hour and a half and £3.10 for two hours and 30 minutes, meaning that drivers without the right coins must overpay for them too. Nationwide there are 100,000 parking meters yet several councils are still yet to upgrade them to accept the three-year-old 5p and 10p coins. Many local authorities don't use machines that offer change because they could become targets for theft. Experts fear the problem could become even worse when the new 12-sided pound coin is released in 2017. This is because their hourly charges often end in 5p and 10p yet the machines do not accept new five or 10p coins, making it impossible for drivers to pay the exact fee. Manchester drivers have demanded refunds and want to know why the council is yet to upgrade its machines. Darren Edwards, 42, was forced to overpay for his parking as the machine could not take the correct change. He said: 'I know it is not much but if you think how often those parking spots are used, and if everyone is over paying that soon adds up.' Coin chaos: The 5p and 10p pieces introduced three years ago are slightly thicker than the old ones, which means that a considerable number of machines still reject them . The parking machine he used currently charges of £1.25 for an hour's parking, £1.85 for an hour and a half and £3.10 for two hours and 30 minutes. But a sticker says it will not accept the new silver coins. The new thicker nickel-plated steel coins were introduced in 2012 by the Royal Mint and since then, 330million are in circulation while older copper-nickel coins have been steadily recalled. Industry chiefs insist the bill for converting parking meters, vending machines and phone boxes to accept the new £1 coin could be more than £200million. The 12-sided coin, which resembles a classic threepenny bit, was announced as a way to fight a surge in the number of £1 in circulation - a racket that costs the economy some £45million a year. But roughly 1.2million machines on the market will have to be re-calibrated to fit the new piece, which is set to be introduced in 2017, according to one industry expert. Payphones, parking metres, betting shop fruit machines, launderette washing machines and supermarket trolleys are among the devices that will need to be upgraded. Last year the Royal Mint suggested that the cost of converting these machines would be around £20million. But company chiefs have today disputed the amount - calculating that it could me more than five times as much. Jonathan Hilder, CEO of the Automatic Vending Association, estimated that forgeries make up some 3.03 per cent of the more than 1.5billion £1 coins in circulation. He said that increasingly sophisticated technology meant that coins were easier to fake - and that 50 per cent of these counterfeit coins successfully passed through vending machines. The new coin  will be made from two types of metal, like the current £2 coin. A Freedom of Information request to Manchester council revealed the town hall made £14.8m from car parking in 2013/14. Coun Luthfur Rahman, the council's assistant executive member for environment, said: 'We are in the process of re-calibrating all the pay and display machines to accept the new 5p and 10p coins. 'This will be completed by the end of the month. 'There is also an alternative payment method - Pay by Phone - which doesn't require correct change as the tariff is charged directly to the customer's credit or debit card via their mobile phone. 'This cashless method also allows customers to purchase further parking time, up to the maximum permitted, with no need to return to the pay and display machine, as well as providing text reminders when their parking time is about to expire.' In recent years drivers have complained about similar problems in towns and cities all over the UK. Councils in Sheffield, Brighton, Telford, Hull and in Edinburgh are among many who admitted to problems. The vending industry said updating machines could local authorities as much as £100million to modify parking meters and called the coin charges 'a disaster'. Because of the cost of changing machines, or having machines able to give change, councils are encouraging people to pay in other ways. A spokesman for the British Parking Association said: 'Mobile phone technology is beginning to revolutionise the way parking is paid for and offers more flexibility than static coin machines. 'Parking providers are already offering other cashless payment methods including credit cards and pre-booking. Some smart phone apps allow motorists to scan QR codes on signage instead of feeding a machine, all of which cut time, offer variety and ease of payment'.\",\n",

Ana Elizondo made headlines in 2012 after she was kidnapped from a parking lot when she was leaving a night class at the University of Texas, Pan American. The psychology graduate student, 27, was blindfolded and transported through several cars as her abductors made a failed attempt to cross the Mexican border. Ana Elizondo made headlines in 2012 after she was kidnapped from a parking lot as she was leaving a class at University of Texas, Pan American. She was released unharmed the following day after one of the kidnappers introduced her to his mother who helped her escape to another location . She escaped the hands of her captors the following day unharmed and said she tried to keep in good spirits for much of the time she was kidnapped. Miguel Angel Cruz Navarro was reportedly the ringleader of the kidnapping. He was sentenced to 34 years in prison in 2014 . On Tuesday she will open up about her experiences on the popular true crime documentary show House of Horrors: Kidnapped on Investigation Discovery. Elizondo has said in prior interviews that she was determined to look strong throughout the kidnapping, according to the Panamerican Online. She said in 2013: '(I thought) which one of these guys is going to rape me? All these thoughts were going through my head. 'I was very kind to them. I cracked jokes with them to get out of the situation mentally. 'They saw me as a good person and I think that's why I wasn't physically harmed or raped or anything like that.' An investigation revealed that Elizondo was targeted by the kidnappers because her father was a well-known wealthy business man in the area, according to The Inquisitr. The men demanded a $160,000 ransom when they first called Elizondo's father. She was told by the kidnappers that her father lived a secret life and sold alcohol and cigarettes to the Mexican drug cartel. But eventually, one of the kidnappers introduced Elizondo to his mother, who helped her escape to another location where her parents could reach her. The kidnappers, named as Milton Treviño, Miguel Angel Cruz Navarro, 35, and Onan Herrera-Sanchez, 28, were all arrested. Investigators revealed the Elizondo was targeted because her father was a wealthy and well-known businessman in the area. The kidnappers demanded a $160,000 when they first reached out to the psychology graduate student's father . Investigators said that Treviño, Herrera-Sanchez and Navarro's wife Elva Navarro were responsible for taking Elizondo from the parking lot. Navarro, who was supposedly the ringleader of the operation, was sentenced to 34 years in prison in April 2014, according to FOX Rio. Treviño, who pleaded guilty in the case in 2013 was sentenced to ten years in prison and Herrera-Sanchez was sentenced to 20 years. Elva Navarro was sentenced to three years in December 2014 to three years for her role at a spa that injected women with a deadly fake botox, according to Valley Central. She is still facing kidnapping charges, among others.\",\n",

A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of murder after an 18-year-old was stabbed to death in a scuffle outside KFC. Sheriff Mbye died in hospital two hours after he suffered multiple stab wounds in a brawl which also left a 19-year-old in a critical condition. Police were called to a KFC restaurant in Northfield, Birmingham, shortly after 5pm yesterday after reports of a stabbing. When officers arrived they found a 19-year-old with stab wounds in a barber shop being tended to by customers. A murder investigation has been launched and police were alerted to the fact that Mr Mbye had been dropped off outside Queen Elizabeth Hospital in a white Audi which then sped off. The car was later found by police abandoned in Hickman Gardens, Ladywood. An 18-year-old man from Birmingham has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody. Detectives believe a group of other men were involved and are trying to identify them. Forensic teams have sealed off part of Bristol Road South in order to search for clues. Tributes for the 18-year-old from the\\xa0Lee Bank area\\xa0have been flooding in with many describing it as a 'tragic loss of life'. Dee Webb said: 'Awful news..what is happening to our children..another mother is grieving today for her son..This has got to stop..my thoughts are with you all...r.i.p.' And Liz Goodman said: 'What a terrible thing to happen and what a waste of a life. Rip to young Sheriff & thoughts are with his family & friends.'' Tracie Coles said: 'So sad, RIP.

Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, from West Midlands Police said: 'My condolences go to the family of Sheriff who are heartbroken at losing their loved one. 'I would like to reassure them that many people who were in the area at the time responded admirably to the terrible situation which confronted them. Both victims were tended to, details of possible people or vehicles involved were relayed to police and vital clues were guarded. Their assistance has been invaluable to our investigation. Detectives believe a group of other men were involved and are currently trying to identify them .

              " {'sequence': \"Gruesome death rituals performed 1,200 years ago have been uncovered in dozens of tombs in Peru's Cotahuasi Valley. Each tomb was filled with bones of up to 60 mummies, with infants kept in small containers, and others repeatedly ripped to pieces while decomposing. Archaeologists have so far opened up seven of the tombs, recovering 171 broken mummies from the ancient ceremonial site known as Tenahaha. Gruesome death rituals performed 1,200 years ago have been uncovered in dozens of tombs in Peru's Cotahuasi Valley. Pictured is the burial of a young woman found in the middle of one of the tombs. Analysis of her skeletal remains reveal that she suffered dental problems, including the loss of teeth . 'When we think of the dead, we bury the relative and that's it,' Justin Jennings, a curator at Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum told DailyMail.com. 'But back then, in the Andes, you continued to interact with those folks. People were moving bodies around all the time.' The mummies in the tombs ranged in age from several days old to the elderly. But over the years rats had eaten away many of the remains, leaving only fragments. In one tomb, researchers discovered 400 isolated human body parts, including teeth, hands and feet. The few mummies that remained intact were bound by rope and placed in a foetal position. The mummies in the tombs ranged in age from several days old to the elderly. But over the years rats had eaten away at many of the remains.\\xa0This image shows three vessels found by the feet of an individual. The mummies were buried with a variety of items including some beautifally decorated ceramic, pictured . Pictured is the partial skull of an individual found in one of the seven opened tombs. The dead, numbering in the low thousands, towered over the living from in their tombs high on the hills around the valley . 'On occasion, there were mummies that were placed as offerings around the outside of the tombs,' said Jennings. The Middle Horizon period (A.D. 600–1000) was a time of sweeping cultural change in the Andes. Archaeologists have long associated this period with the expansion of the Wari state\\xa0in the south-central Andes and coastal area of modern-day Peru. Along with their expansion, came widespread violence. Skull fragments in some areas of their territory reveal that 50 per cent had dents in their heads caused by violent blows. Pottery in these areas were etched with drawings of fanged teeth and human trophy skulls. But Tenahaha was believed to have been a relatively peaceful area in Peru at that time.\\xa0In Tenahaha, only one per cent of skulls had dents. The pottery at the site is also decorated with what looks like depictions of people smiling. Tenahaha may have served as a 'neutral ground' where people could bury their dead and feast. 'They were broken apart but then placed back together in an anatomically correct position.' Scientists are still trying to understand why some of the mummies and artefacts were broken up in this way. One theory is that the movement of the mummies may have helped create a sense of equality among the community. There is also evidence that the rituals went on for days at a time, with parties being held in the valley below the tombs. Jennings said that the dead, likely numbering in the low thousands, towered over the living from in their tombs high on the hills around the valley. 'It seems to be a place where people were bringing down their dead to that location,' said Jennings. 'They were having parties. There is evidence that they were making and drinking corn beer, and placing offerings underneath them.' But he adds that the picture remains blurry, as the rituals were performed over many years, and likely changed during that time. A study of pottery at the site suggests it was used between about A.D. 800 and A.D. 1000, with the Inca settling there 500 years later. Tenahaha was believed to have been a relatively peaceful area in Peru during those years. Pictured is a dismembered mummy. A tupu, which was an artifact that could have been used to fasten clothing, fell through this mummy’s rib cage when it was moved . Tenahaha appears to have been created as a place where people from nearby villages could feast. Parties, that lasted for several days at a time, were often held in the valley below the tombs. This image shows a storage area where food for feasting could have been kept . Pictured are some of the decorated cups found in the tombs. Human hands, lines, dots and happy faces can be seen. Pottery found in other parts of Peru had more gruesome images, largely due to a culture of violence . The wider area, however, was undergoing dramatic change, with populations growing, agriculture expanding and class differences emerging. At this time, the Wari was being established in the south-central Andes and coastal area of modern-day Peru. And with it came widespread violence. Skull fragments on the islands close by revealed that 50 per cent had dents in their heads caused by violent blows. Pottery in these areas were etched with drawings of fanged teeth and human trophy skulls. In Tenahaha, only one per cent of skulls had dents. The pottery at the site is also decorated with what looks like depictions of people smiling. Jennings believe Tenahaha may have served as a 'neutral ground' where people could bury their dead and feast. 'We have finished the excavations, and we're now trying to look at a different sites nearby during the same period to understand the relationship,' Jennings added. Cotahuasi Canyon near the city of Arequipa in Peru is the deepest canyon in the world, and a site of archaeological significance. The canyon is an impressive chasm that the river has eroded between two enormous mountain massifs: the Coropuna and the Sulimana . Scientists are still trying to understand reasons why some of the mummies and artefacts were broken up in this way. One theory is that the movement of the mummies may have helped create a sense of equality among the community. Pictured is the\\xa0Cotahuasi Valley .\",\n",

Lelisa Desisa, 25, of Ethiopia won with an unofficial time of 2 hours, 9 minutes, 17 seconds and beat his previous winning time by more than a minute on a day when security was on high alert for potential threats to competition's 119th race. Thirty-thousand runners cruised through a damp Monday morning route where well-wishers drew 'Boston Strong' in chalk on the pavement to remember the three dead and more than 260 injured in  attack near the finish line two years ago. Scroll down for video . Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa, who won the Boston Marathon in 2013 before a terrorist attack, was the first-place finisher this year with a time of 2 hours, 9 minutes, 17 seconds .

Rotich finished in an unofficial time of 2 hours, 24 minutes, 55 seconds, edging out Mare Dibaba of Ethiopia in a sprint finish on Boylston Street. 'I got to the last corner and I saw the finish line tape and I thought this is it, I'm not going to let it go,' said Rotich, who gave Kenya its fifth straight women's victory in Boston. Dathan Ritzenhein was seventh overall in the men's race and the first American in at an unofficial 2:11:20, followed by last year's winner, Meb Keflezighi, in 2:12:42.

Carlos Arredondo, a first-responder that year, handed out American flags at the finish line on Monday, . The race comes less than three weeks after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the then-19-year-old Chechen Cambridge resident who brought bombs to the race, was found guilty of all the terrorism charges against him in a trial that saw moving testimony from victims who had lost loved ones and limbs. Tsarnaev, now 21, could face the death penalty after sentencing in federal court. Some victims of the attack have spoken out saying they are against capital punishment for the young man. Newlyweds Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes, who lost limbs in the bombing, said that they support life without parole so that Tsarnaev 'disappears from our collective consciousness as soon as possible,' according to the Boston Globe. 'If there is anyone who deserves the ultimate punishment, it is the defendant. However, we must overcome the impulse for vengeance,' they said.
