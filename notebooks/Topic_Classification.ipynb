Late in the summer of 2012, just a couple of months into the reign of Brendan Rodgers, he was lined up as makeweight in a failed bid to sign Fulham's Clint Dempsey only for the midfielder to reject the move. His determination to prove himself, and justify the Â£16million price tag which came with him from Sunderland the previous summer, has been rewarded not only with a new five-year Â£100,000-a-week contract but with the prospect of him taking over the captain's armband from Steven Gerrard when he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. Jordan Henderson is 'over the moon' after signing a new long-term contract with Liverpool . The club's vice-captain puts pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at Liverpool until 2020 . Henderson has enjoyed a strong campaign and could be handed the armband when Steven Gerrard leaves . But it is the unfulfilled potential which persuaded the 24-year-old England international to commit what should be the best years of his career to the club. 'A few years ago I had an opportunity to leave but I always knew how big this club is and I wanted to stay here for as long as possible - and nothing has changed since then,' he told liverpoolfc.com. 'I feel as though I have got a good connection with the club now and there was no doubt where my future was going to be and it was just a matter of time for my agent and the club to sort it out. 'I have been through difficult times but I would never change that because I know there will be more difficult times ahead and I'll have to use that and I'll be able to handle it a lot better. 'Hopefully we've got many years ahead of winning trophies. 'I'm the same as every other player, I want to be playing at the highest level - in the Champions League, winning trophies and being very successful. 'I had good conversations with the manager about the future of the football club and it was very bright, I was very pleased with what I was hearing. 'I want to be a big part of that and hopefully I can. 'I feel there's a lot of potential, but we need to start turning that potential into winning things. I've got a good feeling that we can do that.' HendersonÂ arrived from Sunderland in a Â£16million deal in June 2011, when Kenny Dalglish was manager . The Liverpool midfielder shoots towards goal during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa . Rodgers hopes other players - youngsters Raheem Sterling (who has rejected a Â£100,000-a-week offer), Jordon Ibe and experienced defender Martin Skrtel are all currently negotiating new deals - will follow Henderson's lead. 'We are obviously delighted. It is great news for the club and Jordan that he will be spending best part of his career and development here at Liverpool and he is a big part of the plan going forward,' said the Reds boss. 'I am delighted for him and the club and we can continue his development. 'The club paid big money for him at the time because he had big potential and that potential has been developed and he will go into the next phase of that. 'The likes of Jordan and Raheem are very important players and the club, behind the scenes, is working very hard to ensure we sign these type of players. 'The model is to develop young players and when they have improved it is important you nail them to the club and make sure they are here for the best part of their careers.'

The game, which dates back to Australia\\'s goldfields and the first recorded games are believed to have taken place in the late 1790s, made a resurgence as a way to pass time in the trenches. On Saturday, as Aussies commemorated the centenary of the landing at Gallipoli, thousands of men and women took their chances with the coin game in the spirit of the diggers. After participating in dawn services and memorial services to remember the sacrifice and bravery of those who landed at Gallipoli in 1915, and to honour all other active and returned servicemen and women, the crowds wandered down to their local RSL or pub to take part in the game of chance. Up and down the country men and women, most with a beverage in hand, were yelling \\'heads\\' or \\'tails\\' as coins were thrown in the air. While the game is considered a form of gambling and is illegal at all other times, two-up is allowed on ANZAC Day across Returned Servicemen League clubs (RSL) and pubs. Versions vary between the original two-coined game (with three outcomes) and three-coined version (with two outcomes), the latter preferred by many venues prefer for ease of betting between punters. Wagering expert Damian Deguara, who writes for website The Great Tip Off, told Daily Mail Australia that: \\'It\\'s that one time of the year when the law permits men and women across this great country of ours to follow in the footsteps of our brave Aussie diggers and keep to the old gambling tradition.\\' \\'Two Up is a pretty simple game, all you need are coins, a wooden stick (the kip) to flip them into the air and a crowd of screaming punters yelling \"heads\" or \"tails\". \\'Most punters have their corner, you are either a heads punter, a tails punter or someone who goes with either depending on your intuition.\\' Scroll down for video . This Anzac Day Australians took advantage of the opportunity to play the century-old tradition of two-up in pubs and clubs all around the country . Crowds at the Australian Hotel Rocks to play two-up- two pennies are placed on a paddle and tossed in the air - frantic bets are part of the game . The game, which dates back to Australia\\'s goldfields and the first recorded games are believed to have taken place in the late 1790s . A two-up participant mourns after losing a two-up bet on Anzac Day . Up and down the country men and women, most with a beverage in hand, were yelling \\'heads\\' or \\'tails\\' as coins were thrown in the air . Once an illegal form of gambling, the game has been legalised in few casinos in Australia and across the country in pubs and RSLs only on Anzac Day . Australian Army soldiers playing two-up : scenes of Army life in Australia during World War II . Versions vary between the original two-coined game (with three outcomes) and three-coined version (with two outcomes) Crowds at the Australian Hotel Rocks were some of hundreds to play two-up on Saturday . As Aussies commemorated the centenary of the landing at Gallipoli, thousands of men and women took their chances with the coin game in the spirit of the diggers . The kip is a small piece of wood which pennies are placed on before they are thrown into the air for punters to bet on . To bet on HEADS you touch your head, the \\'Spinner\\' (one who tosses) is made to do pushups if the bet is lost . During World War II, a game of two-up could last for two or three hours to pass the time .',\n",
